The Aetherials have an uncanny ability to manipulate the dead that is worthy of investigation, but first we must contend with their creations.{^n}{^n}奇形先锋, once living trolls, are being created somewhere out near the Gruesome Harvest. They are resilient and incredibly strong. We cannot allow the Aetherials to maintain such a resource.{^n}{^n}Eliminate 奇形先锋 and cripple the Aetherial forces.{^n}{^n}Your efforts will be rewarded with iron bits.

Kymon's Chosen cannot be reasoned with. They send their flame-wielding Blade Maidens after our people to butcher them like animals.{^n}{^n}We will not stand for this.

And besides, they will serve as excellent minions.{^n}{^n}Iron bits for every slain Blade Maiden.

Legends say that ghouls were once humans. Humans twisted by madness and obsessed with devouring dead flesh.{^n}{^n}Now they are little more than mindless fiends, too far gone to be reasoned with. The Black Sepulcher in the 古代墓地 is teeming with these Corpse-eaters. There is little choice in the matter. They must be exterminated.{^n}{^n}Any such effort shall be rewarded with iron bits.

Ghouls, despicable beings and abominations. The weak ones hide in the shadows, skulking about tombs searching for their next meal.{^n}{^n}But it is the greater ghouls that should strike terror into the hearts of man. They do not fear the sun, do not fear flame. They are the nightmares with which we must contend.{^n}{^n}One such ghoul, we call it Gravvis, has been wandering the Black Sepulcher in the Necropolis. For the sake of Cairn herself, it must be slain.{^n}{^n}Gravvis' elimination will be amply rewarded with materials from our stores.

The Aetherials have proven to be a curious enemy, their powers contending with our own, but we must never let our guard down around the Cult of Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}Their summoners are capable of bringing horrific creatures into this world, but their leader, one Karroz the Sigil of Ch'thon, brings forth the worst.

The Arkovian curse is a horrific display of our master's power, but it also serves as a source of countless curiosities for the Order.{^n}{^n}Deep within 苦痛阶梯, there are Revenants that have learned to manipulate death as we have. It is a twisted mockery of Uroboruuk's spell and must be put to an end.{^n}{^n}Anyone who braves 苦痛阶梯 in order to see this through will be justly rewarded with materials from our stores. The Order shall provide enchantments to assist in the journey.

No Arkovian was spared from Uroboruuk's curse, such was his wrath. But that did not stop the Arkovians from trying to evade it. One such group gathered in a temple hidden away within a flooded cavern near Wightmire.{^n}{^n}There they prayed to their gods and waited for the curse to expire. Their High Priest, Rolderathis, preached sermon after sermon condemning necromancy and praising the Arkovians. To this day, he stands at his ruined altar and spews out the same flawed rhetoric.{^n}{^n}The Keeper of Tomes wishes to reclaim the temple from the undead in order to tap into its archives, what little remains undamaged by the flooding. For this to be accomplished, Rolderathis must be destroyed.{^n}{^n}His elimination will be amply rewarded with materials from our stores.
