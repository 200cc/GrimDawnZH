赏金：费比亚斯
Bounty
费比亚斯 Crowsworth is one of the locals, but sadly he was staying with family in 伯尔维治 when 恐怖黎明 took place.{^n}{^n}Based on the tales I've heard about what happened in the village, I fear the worst. Please, if 费比亚斯 has been turned into one of those undead monsters, I wish that he be put to rest.{^n}{^n}I will gladly share my scavenged supplies in exchange for peace of mind.



杀了费比亚斯
