Culling the Swarm
Kill Viziers + Open Door
Douglass was impressed with how you handled the Dermapterans out in the Rotting Croplands. He is confident in your abilities and believes you can put a stop to the Dermapterans for good. Dermapteran hives are cyclical. Every seven years or so, they birth a new queen, which promptly proliferates their numbers. In the past, the farmers would rally and exterminate the queen while she was still young. But after the Grim Dawn, the Dermapterans were allowed to thrive, and now their queen is a massive creature that spawns new Dermapterans by the dozen every day.
