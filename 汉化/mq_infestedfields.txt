Douglass Oldbarrow has implored you to help the farmers with the Dermapterans infesting the Elmsworth and Thorsnbury farms to the west of Homestead. The Black Legion seems deaf to the farmers' pleas for assistance, but Douglass firmly believes that there simply won't be enough food to go around if additional farmland is not secured. Head out into the infested fields and destroy the Dermapteran egg clusters. That should drive them out.

Return to Douglass
You have destroyed the egg clusters infesting the Elmsworth and Thornsbury farms, along with many Dermapterans guarding them. Return to Homestead and inform Douglass that the farms are once again clear of infestation.
