The Legion requests assistance with a priority target.{^n}{^n}To the north of Homestead, in an area we now call the Conflagration, the Legion was forced to flee from an Aetherial creation known only as the Herald of Flame. This creature spreads aetherfire wherever it goes, and its next target appears to be Homestead. The danger the Herald poses to this region cannot be understated. It must be eliminated at all costs.{^n}{^n}The Legion is willing to share some of its rare materials with anyone that manages to accomplish this impossible task.
