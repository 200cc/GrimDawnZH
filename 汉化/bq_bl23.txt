赏金：烈焰使者
Bounty
The Legion requests assistance with a priority target.{^n}{^n}To the north of Homestead, in an area we now call 战火平原, the Legion was forced to flee from an Aetherial creation known only as the 烈焰使者. This creature spreads aetherfire wherever it goes, and its next target appears to be Homestead. The danger the Herald poses to this region cannot be understated. It must be eliminated at all costs.{^n}{^n}The Legion is willing to share some of its rare materials with anyone that manages to accomplish this impossible task.
