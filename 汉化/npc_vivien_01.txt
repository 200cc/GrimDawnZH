Please, you have have to help us. We won't survive out here alone.
别担心，我这就来帮你们。 
Please, we must get going. Rictor requires aid.
没问题，我把你们俩个带到安全的地方。 (撒谎)
But how will we get Rictor there? Can we carry him?{^n}{^n}I don't want to leave him out here all alone.
I can send you both there via rift. (Lie)
Truly, you can do that?{^n}{^n}You hear that, Rictor? We're going to make it out of this mess. You're going to be ok!
I'll see you at the hideout. (Open Riftgate)
I need a moment.
Oh, thank the gods you found us.{^n}{^n}Please, you have to help us.{^n}{^n}I don't think we'll survive out here much longer. Rictor is hurt pretty bad. I'm not sure he can even stand.
The resistance has a stronghold nearby.
But how will we get Rictor there? Can we carry him?{^n}{^n}I don't want to leave him out here all alone.
Hm, he doesn't look too good.
I know...if you hadn't arrived, I'm not sure how much time he'd have left.{^n}{^n}So let's not waste it. Please help me get him to safety.

让我先和他谈谈。
让我先和他谈谈。
他看起来情况可不怎么好。
我知道……如果不是你的话，我不知道他还能撑多久。{^n}{^n}我们别浪费时间了，请帮我把他弄到安全的地方。
反抗军在附近有一个据点。
可我们怎么把雷克托弄到那里去呢？{^n}{^n}我们能带他穿过城市吗？
我可以用传送门把你们俩都送过去。 (撒谎)
Truly, you can do that?{^n}{^n}You hear that, Rictor? We're going to make it out of this mess. You're going to be ok!
I'll see you at the hideout. (Open Riftgate)
让我先和他谈谈。
我会回来救你们的。
请帮帮我们。
我会派人来救你们的。
