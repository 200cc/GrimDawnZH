The Outcast
The Aetherial Witch

Captain Reave of the Black Legion has determined that all of the Legion's recent troubles stem from the arrival of an aetherial witch in their midst. He is under strict orders not to harm 阿纳斯塔里娅, but you are under no such obligation. Head into the Fort Ikon prison and deal with this traitorous wretch.
