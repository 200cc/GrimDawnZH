赏金：死之亡魂
赏金
The Arkovian curse is a horrific display of our master's power, but it also serves as a source of countless curiosities for the Order.{^n}{^n}Deep within 苦痛阶梯, there are 亡魂 that have learned to manipulate death as we have. It is a twisted mockery of Uroboruuk's spell and must be put to an end.{^n}{^n}Anyone who braves 苦痛阶梯 in order to see this through will be justly rewarded with materials from our stores. The Order shall provide enchantments to assist in the journey.
