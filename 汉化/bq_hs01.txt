Bounty
The Aetherials twist all that is good in this world to their twisted designs. We have witnessed first-hand as they turned our scarecrows into possessed monstrosities that hunt our people.{^n}{^n}幽魂收割者 are capable of attracting ravens that are bound to their will, somewhat ironic. We wish these abominations be destroyed and have set aside iron bits to see the task through.
