赏金
The Aetherials have proven to be a curious enemy, their powers contending with our own, but we must never let our guard down around the Cult of Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}Their summoners are capable of bringing horrific creatures into this world, but their leader, one Karroz the Sigil of Ch'thon, brings forth the worst. One of his personal pets, 纳尔·萨若斯, has an insatiable appetite for human flesh. Horror stories are told of it single-handedly devouring every inhabitant of Darkvale prior to the cult taking the village and the gates beyond.{^n}{^n}Anyone willing to take on this monstrosity will be amply rewarded with materials from our stores.



杀了纳尔·萨若斯
