艾格瑞姆
要不是你我的拯救者，真不知道会怎么样！我怎么感谢你都不够。终于我又能给别人做饭了。拿着，喝点粥！本来要加点盐的，但是这儿的维斯基队长说盐只能用来战斗。
很高兴你在这儿安顿下来了。
你随时都可以回来这儿。如果你想听的话，我有几个老掉牙的故事。
好的，以后吧。老前辈。


很高兴见到你，今天要做点什么？
听你讲一个故事吧。

你对前任典狱长了解多少？我在遥远的首都都听说克里格做出奇怪又暴力的举动的传言了。当他对几次征召置之不理之后，帝都就派了一名执法官……来解决这种窘境。不幸的是，在那个人找到克里格之前，恐怖黎明就来临了。至少，我是这么认为的。
我不知道对别人讲过这件事没有。曾经在帝都我和一位非常无礼的权贵打过交道，他甚至看不起皇帝。那个家伙对他平淡寡味的食物很是不满意，所以我就给他加了大厨特质的重口味调料。这么说吧，他跑了出去，然后身体两端都开始喷饭了。说来也奇怪，我听说第二天他就死了。我希望这跟我使的调料没关系。
我曾经服侍过德里格的追随者。我一般不根据一个人的信仰来评价这个人怎么样，但是那些家伙确实信仰着一些邪门儿的东西。全知之眼，巫神居住的隐秘国度，还有德里格是怎么看守着他的国度。怪不得他们这么紧张，原来他们认为有人无时无刻都在盯着他们看！很有趣的是，确实有人一直在盯着他。在我和他分道扬镳不久之后，一位审判官就把他抓去问话，之后再也没有见过他的人影。至少，我听说这么回事。
想过来一碗炖蛇人肉么？想都别想，它们吃我们我们吃它们虽然看来很公平。但是我试过煮了一次，结果弄坏了我一套锅和勺。意外听说过，蛇人以前是由人类创造的。故事是说帝国的总参谋部想要一支能在南方沼泽作战的部队。可怕的人类实验创造出了一种类人的爬虫动物，可以人类无法控制它们。于是它们逃了出去，在野外繁殖起来。不过我确定这只是一个传说罢了。
在恐怖黎明发生之前，我曾侍奉过一位绅士。他谈到一种使用奥术门来进行旅行的新方法。他们说这法子能让驻扎在帝都的军队几乎瞬间就到达远方的行省。想想帝国总参谋部会有多想这种决定性的军事技术吧。这跟你救我时使用的传送门很相像。
One thing still bothers me about the way events unfolded during the Grim Dawn。 I was working in the capital during the weeks prior to the attack and I remember two of the three legions there were dispatched to remote provinces for seemingly no reason。 It seemed very peculiar to me at the time that they would leave the capital so exposed but, then again, I'm just a simple cook。 Who am I to question the workings of the military?
Don't discount the effectiveness of piercing weapons。 They may not have the raw damage dealing power of a heavy mace or brutal axe but their ability to penetrate armor can be very effective against more heavily armored foes。 At least, that's what I've heard and, you know, my profession has made me very familiar with blades。 Being a cook, I mean。
I've served more than a few men and women whose ambition and lust for power exceeded their good sense。 There are limits to human achievement and when we grasp beyond our ability, it inevitably leads to calamity。 Sorry, that's a bit heavy for mealtime conversation。 What would I know; I am but a cook?
Have you run into the Bloodsworn yet? The fanatical cult devoted to the supposed elder god Ch'thon? The cult has existed forever; some say since before recorded history。 I always thought the myth of an elder god betrayed and gruesomely dismembered was too fantastical to be anything but the stuff of theatre but since the Grim Dawn, it seems the cult has newfound power and desperate men flock to swell their ranks。 When I was wandering the outskirts of Burrwitch, I came upon some cultists who pressed me to join their ranks。 At first they wouldn't take no for an answer but I treated them to some hearty stew and then they troubled me no further。 Never underestimate the power of good cooking。
When I was young, I had the misfortune to witness a banquet that was thrown for five Pathfinders of the biggest Rover bands at the time。 It was supposed to be a peace offering but none of them left alive。 The government thought the Rovers would disband once their leaders were dead but they just chose new ones and moved on。 I regret how they were persecuted in the past but it seems generations spent roaming the wilderness and back roads of these lands while evading agents of the empire prepared them well for the Grim Dawn。 They seem to be weathering it better than most and have taken in many refugees from the empire that once hunted them。
Later old timer。

再讲一个！
我想喝点粥。
给，热乎的。喝完它，你不想违抗我的意志对么？

回见了，老前辈。
哈，我欣赏吃货。但是维斯基队长坚持我们要定量供应。

好的。
