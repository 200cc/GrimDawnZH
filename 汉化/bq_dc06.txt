Bounty: The Bruiser
Bounty
Cronley's recruited all manner of cruel and despicable men to his cause, not the least of which is a bastard known as 压碎者 罗曼诺夫.{^n}{^n}Romanov takes savage pleasure in smashing in people's skulls whenever they displease him. Cronley seems to encourage the behavior. To make matters worse, Romanov now appears to be a part of Cronley's inner circle, tainted with Aether crystals that grant him inhuman strength. He is rarely seen away from his boss in the mines below the Four Hills in Old Arkovia. Devil's Crossing has prepared a hefty sum of iron bits to see Romanov put to justice.
