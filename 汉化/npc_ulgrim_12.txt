I know you'll miss me out there all alone, but we all have a part to play in this battle.
我还得做什么？
When the flesh vents around Crown Hill are destroyed, the Fleshworks should be forced open to release the excess heat. That will be your way in.{^n}{^n}I'm afraid I have no clue as to what you'll find when you enter that living nightmare.{^n}{^n}Stick to the shadows, friend.
是时候解决这些了。Time to finish this.
I'll get moving.
Seems we must once again toy with death.{^n}{^n}Are you ready to begin the assault?
计划是什么？What's the plan?
Preliminary reports indicate that the main entrance to the Fleshworks is on the northeastern end of Crown Hill. It's sealed tight behind some thickly armored fleshy barrier.{^n}{^n}However, we also know that the Aetherials have several flesh vents around the district emitting immense amounts of heat. If enough of them are destroyed, then the entrance may be forced open in order to compensate for the loss of ventilation.While I mobilize our forces for a frontal assault, you will need to seek out these vents and destroy them. It may be our only chance of getting inside and ending this Master of Flesh before his grand plan comes to fruition.{^n}{^n}Once you're inside the Fleshworks, I'm afraid you'll be on your own. Good luck.
I'll take care of the vents.
我需要一些时间来准备。I need some time to prepare.
I've collapsed the vents.
Good. We'll keep them occupied while you breach the Fleshworks.{^n}{^n}I'm afraid I have no clue as to what you'll find when you enter that living nightmare.{^n}{^n}Stick to the shadows, friend.
I'll see you when this is over.
我有其他的问题。I have some questions.
时机是现在么？Is now really the time?{^n}{^n}At the peak of battle?
我们对血肉领主了解多少？What do we know about 血肉领主?
Formerly Theodin Marcell, this Aetherial is the mastermind behind the Malmouth invasion. He also appears to be one of the leaders of the Aetherial invasion, as his name appeared in missives regarding something they call a Consensus.{^n}{^n}He is responsible for countless atrocities across Erulan, including the invasion of Port Valbury and the creation of the Amalgamation that would have attacked Homestead if not for you. Destroying him won't bring back the fallen, but perhaps it will prevent future calamities.
这一次我们的计划又是什么？
我想问问些其他的事情。I want to ask something else.
我马上回来。I'll be right back.
How will we ever rid Malmouth of this infestation?
We can start by eliminating the brains of the operation, this so called Master of Flesh.{^n}{^n}Beyond that...I suppose fire and lots of it.
这一次我们的计划又是什么？
我想问问些其他的事情。I want to ask something else.
我马上回来。I'll be right back.
你原先碰上过这样的事情么？Have you ever seen anything like this?
Not even in my worst nightmares. When I last passed through this region, the city was already fallen, but the growth of the Fleshworks had not yet begun.{^n}{^n}It's a chilling realization, just how quickly it spread in such a short time.
这一次我们的计划又是什么？
我想问问些其他的事情。I want to ask something else.
我马上回来。I'll be right back.
不要介意，我们的计划是什么？Nevermind, what's our plan?
不要介意。Nevermind.
我马上回来。I'll be right back.
So this is what the Aetherials have envisioned for us all.{^n}{^n}I'm sure they won't mind that we let ourselves in.
所以我现在做什么？So what do we do now?
