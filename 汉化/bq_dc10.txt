赏金：Igor
Bounty
"格斗士" 伊戈尔  was a brutal man with more muscle than brains back before 恐怖黎明.{^n}{^n}Now rumor is that he's accepted Cronley's 虚化水晶 to become even stronger. If such a beast of a man ever decides to attack 恶魔十字, he could cause some serious harm.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down the Brawler and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.



杀了"格斗士" 伊戈尔
