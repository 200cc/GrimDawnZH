艾格瑞姆
One horror down, gods know how many to go.
我有一些问题。I have some questions.
我能为你做什么？What can I do for you?
马尔茅斯未来将会怎么样？What's next for 马尔茅斯?
We will have to exterminate the last of 虚灵 still infesting the city.{^n}{^n}In time, 马尔茅斯 will become a valuable bastion for our forces and, if we can revive the factories here, a place to start creating the weapons, ammunition and armaments the Black Legion will need to continue in this war.{^n}{^n}With all the terrors beyond these walls, the people here will not be able to lead normal lives just yet, but at least they can stop hiding and make a real contribution to the war effort.
我又起的问题。我有另外一些问题。
我明白了。我明白了
肉体加工场怎么处理？What about the Fleshworks?
完全清理掉马尔茅斯的虚灵将会消耗一定的时间，我想我们我们还需要奋斗许久。It will take time to fully clear out 虚灵 from 马尔茅斯 and then...I suppose we'll need fire and lots of it.{^n}{^n}Rebuilding 重建马尔茅斯将会花费数年的时间。 will take years.
我有另外一些问题。
我明白了
你认为西奥丁·马塞尔真的死了么？Do you think 西奥丁·马塞尔 is truly dead?
虚灵并不能够被传统的方法完全消灭。It does not appear that Aetherials can truly be killed, at least not by traditional means.{^n}{^n}But it is without a doubt that his banishment and the loss of 马尔茅斯 will send ripples through the Aetherial chain of command.{^n}{^n}I pray that we are prepared for whatever comes next, should 虚灵 retaliate.
我有另外一些问题。
我明白了。
在你经历过虚空之中那些事情后你还好么？Will you be alright after what happened in the void?
虽然手臂还在逐渐恢复当中，至少头疼已经没有再复发了。I think the arm's healed as well as it can, but at least the headaches have stopped.{^n}{^n}Will I ever truly be alright? I'm not sure I can say that without a smirk. But I'm here, I'm alive, and that's what matters.
我有另外一些问题。
够公平。
不要介意。Nevermind.
科瑞尼亚已经转变成了虚灵。 appears to be an Aetherial.
我们窝里还有另外一条蛇在窥伺，是吗？Another snake in our nest, eh?{^n}{^n}I'm not quite convinced they are on our side, or on anyone's side but their own for that matter.{^n}{^n}But do not worry. At the first sign of betrayal, they will both be met with a silent blade.

I think we can trust them.
Good, we cannot take chances.
再见。
One horror down, gods know how many to go.
再见。
