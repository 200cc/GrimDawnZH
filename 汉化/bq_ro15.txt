We have now broken that oath in order to defend ourselves from Cronley's men.{^n}{^n}So that not all of our ways are lost, we seek to craft an old relic known as Equilibrium, so that we can restore some balance to our lives.{^n}{^n}We will gladly exchange some of our rare scavenged materials in exchange for this valuable object.
