神选者莱格特
将正义的审判带给我们的敌人吧。 [[ms]兄弟[fs]姐妹]。
我一定会的。
My mace thirsts for heathen skulls. It is bizarre to find one standing right before me so unconcerned. 
I am on your side. 
That remains to be seen.{^n}{^n}If it were up to me, you would have been gutted at the door, but for now you are welcome to roam our halls. 
 
 
What do you have against the Order? 
Their blatant disregard for death disgusts me. They toy with the domain of the gods, thinking themselves above the Divine plan.{^n}{^n}I will see the world rid of their kind so that good men and women may inherit her fertile lands. 
Perhaps there is a misunderstanding? 
There is no misunderstanding. The necromancers are no better than the Aetherials and Chthonians threatening to wipe us out.{^n}{^n}They would see us burn in damnation. 
 
Time will tell on who is right. 
 
I see. 
Not going to argue with you. 
我的狼牙棒渴望击碎异教徒的头骨。你在这附近见到卑劣的教团成员了么？
你为何如此厌恶教团？
他们对死亡的公然忽视令我厌恶。 他们玩弄诸神的领域，认为自己高于神圣计划。{^n}{^n}我非常希望他们那种人能从世界上永远消失，那样善良的人们就能在这片肥沃的土地上好好生活了。
你们之间可能存在某些误会?
不存在误会。 死灵法师几乎和虚灵以及冥煞一样试图除去我们。{^n}{^n}他们想看到我们在诅咒中燃烧磨灭。
那么他们全部都要死。
时间将会告诉我们谁是正确的。
这是一个很高的目标。
他们在这片地区随处可见。
恐怕不是吧。
