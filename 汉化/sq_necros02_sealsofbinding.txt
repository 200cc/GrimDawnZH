Order of Death's Vigil
Seals of Binding
收集Seals
The ritual involved in bringing back Malkadarr is a complicated one and unstable one. The cultists in the 血森林 use Seals of Binding to stabilize their rituals. Gather some of these Seals for Master Varuuk at 悲伤城堡 so that the Order can use them to bring back Malkadarr's souls from beyond the veil of death.
