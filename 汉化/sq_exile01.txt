Now that you've allied yourself with 阿纳斯塔里娅, the witch who has been aiding the Black Legion, she has asked you to acquire some rare materials for her sorcery. 阿纳斯塔里娅 requires an Ancient Heart, from powerful beasts and animals, a vial of Blood of Ch'thon, from high-ranking cultists and their chthonian minions, and a Tainted Brain, from a powerful Aetherial. Once you have all three, bring them back to her at the Fort Ikon prison.
