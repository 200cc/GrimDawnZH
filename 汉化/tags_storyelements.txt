tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA01Name=审判官克里德的日志-第一章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA01codexTitle=审判官克里德-第一章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA01Text=此时此刻，我正在赶往调查伯尔维治的路上，最近有人报告在这个区域里发生了一些奇怪的事情。黄昏正在逐渐笼罩恶魔十字，附近阴森的沼泽提示着在晚上赶路可不是个好主意。我只好勉强住进了下游渡口的一个脏兮兮的小旅馆。{^n}{^n}也许经过一段匆匆忙忙的旅途之后，我应该感到很疲乏，但我似乎感到空气中有一种奇怪的压迫感，使我的情绪保持着紧张的状态。这种感觉就好像在一个雷鸣般的夏季风暴即将到来之前，太阳仍然是光芒四射，甚至空中连一朵云都看不见。寂静，却令人害怕。这里的一切事物似乎都处于它们正常的状态，看不出来任何端倪，但我的直觉告诉我，某种可怕的事情将要到来了……

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02Name=审判官克里德的日志-第二章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02codexTitle=审判官克里德-第二章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02Text=正当收拾行李准备重新踏上前往伯尔维治的旅途时，我收到了来自一个伐木营地的紧急求救，这个营地驻扎在古老林地，位于恶魔十字的西边。奇怪的野兽袭击了那个营地，只留下三个虚弱而脸色苍白的伐木工人。{^n}{^n}到达营地之后，工头神情严肃地向我问好，接着告诉我被野兽咬过的工人发了疯并且逃离了营地。另外，他们还用一种从来没听过的语言彼此交谈。工头把一些动物的遗骸指给我看。那是两只灰狐和一只猎犬，身上长满了令人毛骨悚然的疥疮，躺在房子后面一个草草挖好的坑里。工头告诉我这些动物在接触了那些工人之后，突然暴毙而亡，之后奇怪的绿色蒸气从他们的尸体里上慢慢散发出来。随后，三个伐木工人就病倒在床，精神状态也迅速变得恶化起来。看来这次我来到这片区域进行调查是十分有必要的。

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03Name=审判官克里德的日记-第三章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03codexTitle=审判官克里德-第三章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03Text=在穿过了被称为尸妖泥沼的一片阴沉区域过后，我终于到达了伯尔维治。多年来，人们悄悄地讲述关于在尸妖泥沼里发生的一些超自然事件，事实上，单单是听到这片沼泽的名字，已经足够让人心里发毛了。说实话我并不太相信这些人，但最近发生的一系列事情难道不是在某种程度上证实了这些老掉牙的故事？{^n}{^n}抵达目的地之后让我感到惊讶的是，住在伯尔维治的恶魔十字典狱长似乎预料到了我的到来。当我刚踏进镇上，一个男仆就向我问好并坚持要我接受典狱长克里格的邀请去他的庄园歇息。这有点不同寻常，但我还是接受了邀请，因为假如想要调查一下克里格庄园，这可能是最好的方式了。{^n}{^n}由于克里格邀请我今天就要去他那里吃晚餐，使得我这次对伯尔维治的访问变得十分短暂。这似乎证明真相正在慢慢浮出水面。

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04Name=审判官克里德的日记-第四章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04codexTitle=审判官克里德-第四章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04Text=我在典狱长克里格的庄园里做客已经有一周时间了，在这期间我每天都在暗暗担忧着某种可怕的事情会降临这儿。每天我都出门，在伯尔维治附近调查另外一件不同寻常的罪行和一些不详的流言，在这些流言中一部分只不过是些嚼舌头的谣言，或者是某本小说里的天方夜谭，但是另外的一些调查情况也让我的方向变得愈渐模糊。我认为这里存在一种新的模式，不过我暂时还无法把这些片段拼接到一起。{^n}{^n}这段时间内我做了许多无关紧要的事情，为自己提供一些借口，以便能够在伯尔维治待的更长久一些。渐渐地，克里格成为了我调查的重点对象。尽管确信克里格正在参与某种神秘活动，同时还为自己披上了一层伪装，我也无法找出能够指控他进行不法行为的确切证据，这样的证据意味着我们能够对他实施正式的官方调查。{^n}{^n}庄园里的很多区域对我都是没有开放的。克里格和他的拜访者们经常在楼上的一些房间进进出出，我没有权限进入里面。更奇怪的是，一天夜里我醒来后听到了类似马车赶路的嘎吱作响声，我推开窗子朝下面的村庄寻找声音的来源却什么也没有发现。这些声音是从哪里来的？猫和老鼠的游戏仍在继续，不过迄今为止，还不知道谁是猫，谁是老鼠……

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05Name=审判官克里德的日记-第五章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05codexTitle=审判官克里德-第五章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05Text=我败给了克里格，他饶了我一命，把我关在了这庄园的地牢里。{^n}{^n}意识到呆在这里没有办法能够继续进行调查，我费尽力气强行挤进了庄园里原本被封闭的区域，然后发现自己正身处于一个十分可怖的环境里。我本该明白那附在锁上面的奇怪魔法证明我并非只是简单的对付些凶恶的神秘学者。{^n}{^n}我穿过一个满是腐烂尸体的房间，男人的，女人的都有，他们无一例外地都遭受了残忍的酷刑或者可怕的实验。在庄园的后方我找到一扇通往下层的门，进去以后我很快在这个极大的地牢里迷了路。很快我就感觉到黑暗中有什么东西在移动，他们很快靠近并包围了我。我正要以死相搏的时候，克里格巨大的身躯在阴影中渐渐浮现，脸上毫无表情。他开口说话了，冷酷的语气仿佛一切都很自然平常，邀请我参观他的设施。尽管我很清楚这不是什么好事，但这样至少我不用去对抗眼前这些可怕的怪物了。

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06Name=审判官克里德的日记-第六章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06codexTitle=审判官克里德-第六章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06Text=我在这个阴冷的牢房已经度过了一天一夜，内心充满不安和恐惧。克里格让我亲眼目睹他们保存尸体的过程，他称之为荣耀黎明。{^n}{^n}我在克里格身上隐约产生了一个想法，就是加入他或者受他摆布。从他的言行中推断这些仅仅是他的计划中一个极小的部分，背后一定还有更大的阴谋。我猜想其他的许多处于关键职务的人也受到了某种东西的控制，就像现在的克里格一样。最初面对克里格时，我对自己十分自信，甚至有些傲慢，但我远远低估了我们将要面对的威胁与力量。{^n}{^n}幸运的是，克里格同样也有这种傲慢的心态，他轻视了囚犯的智慧。他让我选择抛弃人性发誓对他效忠，或者成为那些封存尸体中的一员。克里格把我一个人留下考虑他给出的选择，但这件牢房虽然被魔法封印，却无法禁锢我的爱好，我并不打算呆在这儿直到克里格来听我的答复。

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07Name=审判官克里德的日记-第七章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07codexTitle=审判官克里德-第七章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07Text=离我上一次写日记已经过去很久。在我逃离克里格的实验室的过程中，我与时间和失落赛跑，穿越黑暗和火焰，并目睹了我曾熟悉的世界的崩塌。{^n}{^n}正如我假定的首都中极有可能有关键人物已经被那种如今被称为虚灵的生物所占据，我推断只有在首都内部的支持下我们才有希望挫败虚灵。在真相被揭开之前，首都外部发生的一切行动都将被视为政治叛乱并且被帝国自身的军队所镇压。因此，我决定破釜沉舟，火速赶往伊露兰帝国的核心，并且尽力将自己隐藏起来。{^n}{^n}刚来到这里时，我谨慎地前行，在靠近西门的一个肮脏的旅馆定了一个房间以图掩饰我的到来。起初我找出曾经的老熟人，假如我察觉到他们在性格和行为举止上有所变化，就有可能揭露出虚灵的占据者。经过几次尴尬的相聚，我痛苦地发现近几年作为审判官到处东奔西走执行公务的生活使得我和旧友们失去了联系并且无法分辨出他们的改变是由于被虚灵占据还是由于时间的流逝和褪色的记忆。最后孤注一掷的办法是回到光明会的根据地汇报并看看会由此引出什么。我并没有在那里达到这个目标。{^n}{^n}等到阳光渐淡，下方街道上的人群散去，我起身离开时却相当震惊地发现一个模糊的人影不知道用什么方法静悄悄地闯入了我的房间，避开了所有防止入侵的守卫。这就是我开始和第一刃合作的原因。

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08Name=审判官克里德的日记-第八章 
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08codexTitle=审判官克里德-第八章
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08Text=众所周知，任何大规模煽动不满或者对国王的统治构成实际威胁的人都有可能被第一刃造访。我未曾搅入这样的纷争，但是我经常幻想，如果发生这样的冲突，我就可发掀起一场令人尊敬的战役。然而我始终没有得到机会。不知不觉地，在我意识到发生了什么之前我就被缴械了。如果他想要杀了我，我甚至无法看到死亡镰刀的落下。然而，他似乎对问话更有兴趣，并且他转而告诉了我一段关于他自己的事件，他的叙述证实了我最害怕发生的事。{^n}{^n}第一刃透露，就在几天前，他被迫将刀口指向了国王，而发出这个指令的人正是国王自己。尽管有着无数的护卫保护着国王，其中有世俗的卫士也有奥术师，但是他依然被虚灵控制了。依靠心灵的力量，他夺取了足够长的控制身体的时间来召唤第一刃，发出了处决自己的指令并且要求这位杀手保护他的儿子（年轻的王子殿下），使其重新收回王位。{^n}{^n}随着国王发出他的最后一条指令，他的意识在虚灵的控制下再一次滑落，随后发生了一场殊死的战斗。第一刃说他相信国王和他体内附身的虚灵一并被他杀死了，但是考虑到他对这种生物缺乏经验认识，无法给出肯定的答案。然后他说他已经将王子秘密的带走并且将他隐蔽起来但是拒绝透露更多的细节。第一刃说他意图辞去他的帝国军衔并且改名为艾格瑞姆，我很好奇这个名字是不是刻意参照了神话中的人名。{^n}{^n}最后一个令人烦恼的细节是并没有关于国王死亡的诏书公布。这不仅证明虚灵们对于宫廷有着足够的控制力来隐藏国王的死讯，但是考虑到他们不可能希望长时间隐藏国王的缺席，因此这从另一方面也说明虚灵的计划即将进入下一阶段。{^n}{^n}我和阿尔格瑞姆一起制订战略直到深夜，详细制订了一个对抗虚灵的计划，但是最终我们一致认为我们不可能及时地挫败虚灵门的阴谋。我们最后唯一的方式就是聚集所有我们能够聚集的人力和资源，转入地下活动并经受住即将到来的风暴，然后找到一条反抗入侵者的道路。{^n}{^n}我们一致认为黑色军团将最有希望成为我们最坚实的盟友。作为一个由罪犯、负债人和政见异议者服役的征召军团，在能够通过控制军队最高统帅来间接控制他们的前提下，虚灵门似乎不太可能有什么原因会去渗透他们。那么下一步就是对他们展开联系。


tagLoreObject_PrisonNoteName=粗糙潦草的笔记
tagLoreObject_PrisonNoteText=如今，我不是一个正派的人而且我的确不擅长写作，但是关于这个鬼地方的真实面目的文字需要被传达出去。这个监狱，不像我曾经进去过的任何一个，我能够在名单中看到两个我的名字。犯人从不会在这里久待，并且有些他们拉进来的年轻人并不是罪犯，我看得出来。当我看到一个犯人时，他的眼睛能够告诉我他曾经做错了事。而那些男孩呢？我在他们眼里只看到了害怕。{^n}{^n}我曾见过典狱长两三次，他是个穿着黑色盔甲的高大男人。如果你是一个明事理的人，你一定会认为他应该站在这些栏杆的里面而不是外面。每一天，他和他的侍从们将犯人成打地从监狱中带到院子中的那个小屋里。而这些犯人再也没有出来。然后，一辆四轮马车滚滚而入这间小屋，并且总是满载而出。{^n}{^n}他们不再拉我们离开牢房了，但是我看得出来已经没有多少人留下了。整个大厅静悄悄的。我是我们这一排最后一个人。其他人？他们在昨天的分批处理中被带走了、。我并不是在哀告怜悯，我知道我的生命将终结于那间小屋，但是这篇日志可能会是我可悲的生命中一件好事吧。。。


tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA01Name=港务长的日志-下游渡口
tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA01codexTitle=港务长的日志
tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA01Text=今年的秋雾出现得很早，但是交通仍然异乎寻常地拥堵。有着源源不断的小艇从玛尔茅斯下来以及从其他小镇驶向东北。有些小艇仅仅是漂浮在海上，船上装着的货物看起来是他们的全部家当。这些旅行者，有时候是整个家庭，带来了许多关于战争和非自然死亡的奇怪的故事。成串的废话惹恼了温和的市民，同样也使得码头嘈杂不堪，虽然我不能抱怨出来。大多数旅行者是向西行的，试图尽可能地远离这里。{^n}{^n}码头里的年轻人也开始失去勇气了。有些年轻人之间开始谈论关于启程向西的事宜，但是我相信这些都是很快就揭过的胡言乱语。年轻人总是容易心血来潮。

tagLoreObj_BurrwitchB01Name=港务长的日志-伯尔维治
tagLoreObj_BurrwitchB01codexTitle=港务长的日志
tagLoreObj_BurrwitchB01Text=又一艘小艇到站了，里面装满了套着头罩的囚犯，约莫有几十个。和往常一样，一辆四轮马车在等待着他们，但是据我所知，马车不会把他们带出很远。码头上装货的一个男孩刚刚拜访完伯尔维治的新医生回来，他说看到这辆马车停在典狱长的宅邸外面。小伙子询问了这些囚犯的信息，其中一个操作者告诉他这是“康复”。我并不清楚这意味着什么。{^n}{^n}这些礼拜以来已经超过一打的这样的运送囚犯的船到站了。我实在无法想象他们如何能在那个宅邸塞下那么多人。我并不关心那个宅邸有多大，克里格肯定不会将一群没有价值的小偷囚犯保管在他的屋檐下。一些怪异的事情正在那座宅邸里发生着，而我的疑惑没有得到正确的解答。也许我应该写信到玛尔茅斯，邀请其中一位审判官来调查这里的怪事。这并不是说我希望有一位审判官在这里闲逛。他们总是让人感到不安。


tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA02Name=弗朗西斯的笔记
tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA02Text=我被困在这儿了……我终于意识到了，我会死在这间房子里。玛格利特，恐怕你已经死了，所以我不久之后和你团聚也还算不坏。如果奇迹发生的话，如果你还活着回到这儿找到这页笔记的话，我想要你明白我不生你的气。我从不后悔我们在一起，只是我后悔当时发了脾气，对你说了不该说的话。{^n}{^n}我希望你不要因为我要做的事觉得我是个懦夫。他们已经进到了屋子里，我把房门挡住了但他们冲进来也只是时间问题。我能做的只是选择如何面对死亡而已，我宁可作为人去死也不要成那些恐怖的东西或是被活生生地啃食。我会一直爱着你的……{^n}{^n}弗朗西斯

tagLoreObj_WightmireA01Name=给尸妖泥沼血之兄弟会的信函
tagLoreObj_WightmireA01codexTitle=血之兄弟会的信函
tagLoreObj_WightmireA01Text=是时候向盘踞在尸妖泥沼的虚灵发起进攻了。尽管现在我们在伯尔维治上方的山丘集结了力量准备进攻这座村寨。但是，在这之前，我们必须首先确保尸妖泥沼的安全，确保不会有敌人出现在我们后方。{^n}{^n}虽然你们强大而且忠诚，并做好了为冥神牺牲的准备，但是我认为你们现在还未拥有足够的血誓来击败虚灵们。我们最近非常成功地从虚空中召唤出了更多冥神的强力仆从。只需要一个冥灵先锋就能够消灭尸妖泥沼所有的虚灵，甚至可以攻占魔鬼十字，使之成为我们在这个区域的大本营。{^n}{^n}为了生成一个冥灵先锋，你需要获取至少三个人类的血肉。你们可以用你们认为合适的任何方式来获得牺牲品：可以是路边或者流浪者营地里的难民，也可以是你们血誓者自身。在完成任务后请通知我你们的成功。{^n}{^n}大祭司阿尔多·崔格

tagLoreObj_WightmireA02Name=米尔顿·哈特的笔记
tagLoreObj_WightmireA02Text=我恐怕要违背诺言了，我还不想放弃希望，但是外面的情况看起来不太好。当波旁带着我妹妹以及其他团队成员开辟前往恶魔十字的道路时，我自愿前去引开这些腐朽的行尸们的注意力，并且我很幸运地火锅了第一个夜晚。在他们离开前，我注视着波旁的双眼，让他保证我妹妹的安全。他将手臂搭在我的肩膀上，用他那平静又令人心安的嗓音对我说，他会拼尽全力保护队伍，但是我也必须承诺他一些事：我也必须拼尽全力活着离开这里。{^n}{^n}于是我为自己我做了最好的准备。我成功地转移了行尸们的方向，但是现在我被他们完全包围了。我曾经躲藏在一片连在一起的破败的棚户里，当发现这些死尸靠近时就改变位置。虽然我无法找到一条前进之路，但是成功躲到了太阳落山。行尸们通常看起来是很愚蠢的，但是我想他们在昨晚发现了这片河堤，并利用海水冲出了道路，这就像是有什么东西在指导他们。{^n}{^n}我还没有完成诺言，也不想死在这间腐败的棚屋里。当不得不放手一搏时，我会抛弃这些束缚出去奋力一搏。当最坏的设想发生了，而你在我冰冷的尸体上找到这篇日志，很好，请让我妹妹西比尔知道发生了什么并且告诉她要坚强地活下去。我只能希望她可以及时赶到恶魔十字。

tagLoreObj_WightmireA03Name=被尘土覆盖的笔记
tagLoreObj_WightmireA03Text=不久前的一个夜晚，我们发现一群白痴流浪者在我们的藏身处周围游荡。他们手无寸铁，通常都是这样。理所当然的，当我们袭击他们时，他们试图逃跑，但是这毫无意义。于是现在我们多了一群奴隶来挖掘矿井。然而我们不能以煤矿为食，所以我们的食物补给开始慢慢耗尽。流浪者的队伍里也几乎没有多少残羹冷炙。{^n}{^n}随着伯尔维治大桥的毁坏，我们被困在了这片泥沼中。我开始疑惑当初没有跟着克隆利帮向西行是不是一个错误。虽然在荒野之中不像在恶魔十字那边可以有许多措手可得的食物，但是至少他们有着足够的人数。很可能可以捕获数量可观的野猪来养活整个队伍。离开这里？我们除了蛇人和死亡什么都得不到。



tagLoreObj_WardensJournalA01Name=典狱长克里格的日记
tagLoreObj_WardensJournalA01Text=我已经成功占据了我的任务目标，当地的典狱长。我在他的卧室接近他并寻找占据的突破口。我设想会遭到恐惧和怀疑，然而这些人类轻易地接受了这个在他们心目中显然对他们有利的协议。克里格不是一个拥有特别强烈欲望的人但是他是个十分执着的人，并且一直持续不断的刮擦着我的意识，然而我还是控制住了他。{^n}{^n}克里格的职位是其他人类的监管员，这将极大地推动我们的工作。在他庞大的住宅下拥有大量的地窖，我认为这些地窖可以被为我们所用，将其改造成一个地下运输场所来隐藏我们的活动以及人类肉体的运输。为了我们的荣耀黎明还有大量的工作要做，但是我非常喜欢这具肉体，而且它有着许多优势。

tagLoreObj_WardensLabA01Name=盖思兰的笔记-第一章
tagLoreObj_WardensLabA01Text=我们并不清楚为什么这些虚灵会对肉体保存这么感兴趣。一位同事设想他们可能是要用这些人类尸体作为以后带来更多他们的同类到我们王国时用来占据的容器。{^n}{^n}装载着尸体的马车夜以继日地不断涌入。尸体的绝对数量已经多到令人吃惊，我开始怀疑他们并不是像他们所说的一样仅仅是处决罪犯。

tagLoreObj_WardensLabA02Name=盖思兰的笔记-第二章
tagLoreObj_WardensLabA02Text=今天我们开始了试验的第二阶段，但是结果并不是如我所预期的那样。我们的保存的尸体在几个月至多几年内从表面腐坏。我们的虚灵监工看起来很满意，他或者说是它突然将手放在其中一具尸体上并且释放出一股虚无能量闪光。然后令人触目惊心的事情发生了，这些尸体就好像再次活过来一般。{^n}{^n}然而更让我感到苦恼的是这些尸体显然不适合作为虚灵的宿主,因为据我所知虚灵更喜欢活的宿主。他们搬运进这里的庞大数量的尸体表明了一个更糟糕的现实：这是一支军队。

tagLoreObj_WardensLabA03Name=盖思兰的笔记-终章
tagLoreObj_WardensLabA03Text=这将是我最后一次记笔记了，因为我打算结束自己的生命。我无法再忍受自己执行这些令人憎恶的实验了。我之前的行为可能已经算是泯灭了人性。虽然我曾长期避开我在研究院的同事并认为虚灵们可以给我提供更好的待遇，但是现在我觉得我不能再成为它们的一员了。我害怕如果他们找到了我的身体，他们会将我的尸体用作他们的实验，因此我必须小心谨慎。将我复生为那些行尸的一员。。。我无法容忍这件事情的发生。

tagLoreObj_WardensLabB01Name=赞布兰特的笔记

tagLoreObj_BookC01Text=To understand the flows of the Aether, one must first learn to appreciate its inherent risks. The arcane art is not a plaything, nor is it a tool meant to be abused. Countless young arcanists have lost their lives to carelessness and malpractice. Proper control of the Aether requires years of practice under the careful supervision of the Gildam Arcanum, the only formal office sanctioned to instruct and research the art of the arcane. Do not confuse what is lectured here with the teachings of the hypothetical witch gods, a common misconception amongst the uneducated. There are no gods. There is only reality and the science of the arcane.

This technique is a stellar example of how the Gildam Arcanum continually strives to break our preconceptions of the Aether, creating entirely new schools of thought within the arcane arts.

tagLoreObj_BookD01Text=In all the history of our great nation, there has been no greater atrocity committed than the creation of the vile vermin we call Slith. Part man, part serpent, the Slith were a testament to the dangers of the arcane and served as the driving force behind the formation of the Gildam Arcanum and its tighter sanctions on arcane practices.{^n}{^n}The Slith owe their existence to the actions of a single individual: Oswald Hargate. Backed by family wealth and a passion for research, Oswald aspired to leave his mark upon the study of the arcane. Little did he know that his legacy would leave a permanent stain upon all Arcanists and their field.

tagLoreObj_BookD02Name=蛇人的起源-第二页

Convinced that he could supersede the gods, Oswald set out to perform his heinous research in a, to this day, unknown location.{^n}{^n}Though not much is known about the exact details of his research, the results were quite clear. Calling his creation a Slith, for its slithering movement and snake-like lower body, Oswald triumphantly announced his findings to the Arcanum Society. The abomination bore the torso of a man and the tail of a snake, though its reptilian snout was unlike either species. Its eyes stared back at you with a hint of human sorrow, though it was clearly a dulled mind with no indication of a human conscience trapped within the slith body.{^n}{^n}Those attending were shocked by the blatant disregard for the gods and their domain. Following a brief trial, Oswald was charged with endangering society and was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. The specimen was destroyed and its ashes scattered to the winds. With Oswald behind bars and the slith dead, all believed that the nightmare was over; but they were wrong.

The slith were incredibly invasive, easily dominating the local food chain and reproducing at an alarming rate.{^n}{^n}As their numbers multiplied, the slith adapted a primitive tribal hierarchy, with certain members of their packs exhibiting clear authority over the rest. And, perhaps most alarmingly of all, shamanistic behavior was reported among the slith population, indicating a strong connection to the Aether and perhaps their unnatural origins.{^n}{^n}All efforts to exterminate the slith proved fruitless, with the species simply returning at a new location from hidden nests and caverns. It is without a doubt that the actions of one arrogant individual will continue to reverberate across countless generations to come.

It is our sacred duty as scholars to leave a mark upon the world!{^n}{^n}My wife, Helen, and my dearest daughter Ellena will be joining me soon at our new home.

Its short lifespan and rapidly shedding skin made for a malleable test subject. The initial results seemed promising at first.

Unfortunately, none of the samples survived beyond a couple weeks, their higher brain functions being seemingly incapable of handling the introduction of additional bodily elements.{^n}{^n}For our second batch of experiments, we molded the adders with a few grobles captured by local trappers. The results were...curious to say the least. While this was not the breakthrough I was looking for, we seem to be heading in the right direction. The dull mind of a groble was capable of adapting to its new body, but its primitive and disgustingly malformed physique would see me become the laughing stock of my colleagues.

I explained that what she witnessed was merely a stepping stone, that those men and women died so that our work would not be squandered on snakes and grobles.

I was assaulted on several occasions while attempting to study their physical functions, but those attacks proved to be little more than outbursts on the verge of death. All of the specimens died shortly after the procedure. Dissection revealed an incomplete hybridization of internal organs. With a dysfunctional digestive system, death was inevitable. But I wonder if perhaps the subjects were too old for the procedure to succeed. If I started over, with a younger candidate, then perhaps I would finally have the results I seek...

Upon returning from a successful campaign against the barbarian tribes of Agarond's Peak, the King raved about a chance meeting with a weary traveler whom he called Mogdrogen. Rhowan, in his generosity, offered the old man the use of his horse. The man, and here is where the King's tale loses all sense, declined the proposal and, speaking in a low voice that only his Majesty could hear, instead offered Rhowan a warning.{^n}{^n}The old man spurted prophetic lies about the impending collapse of our great nation and the fall of the beacon of the west, Arkovia herself. He implored the King to leave his title, his wealth, his very identity behind. There were some amongst the court who urged Rhowan to see his madness through, greedy heads of Arkovian Houses who saw this tragedy as an opportunity to seize power. The Queen, the shining jewel of Arkovia, wept before her King and begged him to reconsider; but Rhowan was resolute. With a single decree, he shattered the royal line and abandoned his ordained post as King of Arkovia. Word of the King's madness spread quickly among the populace. To my great surprise, some of his subjects followed Rhowan's lead, abandoning their livelihoods to follow their despondent ruler into a life of poverty and lost identity.{^n}{^n}It has been three fortnights since that fateful day. The queen lies dead in her chambers. They say she had died of sorrow, from the loss of her King, but I suspect more clandestine causes. The court has fallen into chaos as the great Houses bicker amongst themselves for the empty throne. With no end in sight to the squabbles and no clear line to the throne, my patron, Laudos Vagra, has called for the formation of an Oligarchy, ruled by the heads of Arkovia's elite.{^n}{^n}No good can come of this. Of that I am certain. These days, I cannot help but wonder if Rhowan's prophecy was a self-fulfilling one. Or perhaps this storm was a longtime coming and we were merely too blind to see it. I fear for Arkovia. I fear for her soul.{^n}{^n}Theodokus Vagra, Scribe of Arkovia

I turn around to see the eyes once more, staring back at me. I hear laughter, a child's laughter. Then everything is fire. I try to scream, but nothing comes out. The eyes just stare ahead as I writhe in the flames.{^n}{^n}That is when I awaken, drenched in sweat. It has been like this for five nights in a row.

tagLoreObj_AreaCThornsburyDiary_Text=Oliver doesn't want me writing in here anymore. He says it fills my head with dreams when there's work to be done around the farm. So I've been writing at night, when he's asleep. He cannot stop the muse that pulls the strings of my heart.{^n}{^n}The Lashing Willow, by Daila Thornsbury{^n}{^n}The limbs of the willow tree tapped a steady rhythm against the bedroom window. Another storm was building up on the horizon, but Daila could not shake the feeling that this would not be just another shower. She sat up in her bed and took a quick glance at her husband, Oliver. He was still fast asleep. Not even a hurricane would stir that man from his slumber.{^n}{^n}Daila got up, making sure not to shift the covers off her husband. She tip-toed to the wardrobe and retrieved her gear: a well-worn suit of light leather armor and her trusty sword, Stormheart. The blade sparked with electricity as she removed it from its scabbard. The enchantment was still as strong as the day she had found it in the tomb north of Darkvale. Daila replaced the blade and hooked the scabbard into her belt. She took one last glance at Oliver before heading out the door. It was best he did not know about her little nightly vigils. He would just worry himself sick, and Daila could not stand to see him so obsessed over her safety.{^n}{^n}The wind whipped Daila's hair around her face as she stepped out the front door. The rain was already starting to pick up; the ground was drenched with moisture, turning the path into mud. Daila tread carefully, planting every step on a stone or where the ground was still firm. At last, she arrived at the edge of the weeping willow, where a deep sense of dread immediately overcame her.{^n}{^n}"I knew you'd come out to greet me, Daila my dear," a ghastly voice spoke from behind the tree. Daila drew Stormheart, its sparking surface turning the rain drops into mist. A dark figure showed itself and calmly walked towards her. She could not see the man's face, but she knew well who he was. "Come now, is that any way to greet your brother?" The man spoke again. Daila did not say a word. Instead, she let her blade do the talking for her. The figure countered her blows with a blade of his own, a burning sword that left streaks of fire across the air with every swing. "I see you've been practicing," the man said with a grin forming on his lips.{^n}{^n}Thunder crackled in the sky as lightning flared down from the heavens, briefly illuminating the scene. The light from the storm revealed the face of Daila's adversary, the grisly heavily decayed face of her dead brother. "Dravis," Daila hissed through clenched teeth. She dove in for another attack...

I set off to the foothills and made my way through the warren of low stone walls, fences, and occasional farmhouses. I was careful to move in secret and remain undetected from the horrors that still roam the fields unchecked. I made it to the valley of two hills near the river when I witnessed something I can barely comprehend. {^n}{^n}An unearthly black pillar that was neither stone nor flesh drifting slowly across the land as would a low cloud.  A sickly green glow burned at its core and great writhing tendrils hung from somewhere underneath the shifting back shell. I watched in mounting dread as the unholy obelisk slowed and then, without warning, burrowed the hooks of the dangling tentacles into the ground. The ground began to wither and glow with the same unwholesome green. It was then that the obelisk pulled itself into the ground. With a sound that made me feel as if the earth was dying, it began glowing so bright I could hardly look. Its power seeped into the ground, twisting and corrupting as it spread. {^n}{^n}I lingered for nearly an hour in that place and in that time a great distance around the obelisk had been changed. I was about to leave when the obelisk erupted from the ground and drifted to an untouched patch of land to begin the cycle again. We must act soon or there will be nothing left to save. {^n}{^n}--6th Regimental Scouts of the Black Legion, Renall Oberach

I've always pictured them as heretical lunatics, howling at the moon as they bathe in blood, but the promises of safety may be too much to pass on.

The time when the dismal, suffering world will become reunited with Ch'thon, making the oldest of the old whole again and righting the great wrong perpetrated millennia ago by the false gods! These upstart gods who manipulated the course of our existence, set themselves up to be the objects of worship and have lived off our blood and toil for ages.{^n}{^n}The end time will also bring doom to the wayward Aetherials, past agents of the false gods who were betrayed and then cast into the formless aether once their purpose had been served. They have hindered us, slaughtered our brethren and tried to claim dominance over this world. Yet, we must also thank them, for it is the Aetherials who have unwittingly made possible our ascension by destroying the empire and its inquisition. No longer does the inquisition hunt us, suppress our truths or deny us access to our sacred places. Unshackled from the strictures of the empire, people have awakened from the false dream of civilization and our ranks have swelled.{^n}{^n}Not knowing the history of our world, the Aetherials are ignorant of the doom that we will awaken. They cannot surmise our end game and once they realize what they have set in motion, it will be too late for them to stop us! Our most devoted brethren march with legions of the void for Necropolis. They need only prevent our enemies from breaching our final line for even as they attack our forces, the blood they spill will feed our resurrection ritual. Where once we suffered our greatest defeat, our ultimate triumph shall be reborn and the Loghorrean, forerunner of the end time, will carry the thousand screaming voices of Ch'thon into world and usher in a new age!

Having passed the trials, the only thing that stands between me and the coveted title of necromancer is performing a reanimation.{^n}{^n}I've had the pleasure of seeing our master at work countless times. He is truly a master of the craft, requiring neither reagent nor word to bring the dead back into the living. Uroboruuk claims that this is a matter of practice and form, but I am convinced otherwise. His grasp over death supersedes us all, even his oldest students who, at a whim, may call upon spirits to do their bidding; but even they require binding runes and focusing stones of which our master makes no use of. The dead Uroboruuk brings back don't just serve him; they seem eager to please their master, as if to earn his favor.{^n}{^n}But now it is my turn to join the elite ranks of the Order. I've studied the scrolls, learned the rites and burned the words into my memory through exhaustive repetition. I've gathered the grave moss and the dust from buried bones. I am ready. Tomorrow, I will drag a soul back from beyond the veil of death and force it into skeletal remains. Tomorrow I emerge from the sepulcher as a full-fledged necromancer.

Knowledge is a wealth easily squandered by those who fear it, as evidenced by the near eradication of our Order's founding doctrine, the art of necromancy.{^n}{^n}Mastery of the ultimate fate which awaits all men represents an unparalleled frontier of learning. So it falls upon our neophytes to conquer their fear of death, to accept its harsh lessons. For not even in death does duty end.

As they travelled East, I soon realized that they too were after the same thing as I. They made their way to the cliffs by way of the swamp. In following them, I had walked right into an ambush as I was suddenly attacked from behind.{^n}{^n}The fight was devastating and I destroyed dozens in the ensuing conflict. However, in the midst of battle, several of the Harbingers cornered my Guardian. I first believed they intended to destroy it; but when they exploded, a rush of Chthonic energy surged into my creation and severed our link. The animated mass of bone turned on me, and I knew then that the Harbingers had found a way to corrupt my necromantic creation. I do not yet understand how they were capable of such an act, but it was unlike anything I have ever seen Chthonic beings do.{^n}{^n}If the fiends of the Void are able to harness this power on a larger scale, then even the Order of Death's Vigil will find itself outmatched. I must maintain hope that what I seek will be an answer to fighting this darkness. With each step the power grows and others will be drawn to it. I must hurry.{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk

In my heart, I fear I already know the answer, but dare not speak it out loud. I have no doubt that I have made the right choice. The power I have revived will be humanity's salvation from the blood fiends of the Chthonic Void.{^n}{^n}However, there must always be evil. And when there is no evil left to conquer who or, more frighteningly, what will fill that emptiness? Will we become as reviled as those who we oppose? The Primordial powers have no care or sympathy for humanity. Without shackles, this power I have borrowed could be just as disastrous as, or perhaps even worse than, Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}I now wish I had not burned the town where I awoke this ancient being.

Bones scatted, tombs crumbled, piles of rubble everywhere and one of the bridges was completely destroyed. This is terrible news as it forces us to take long forgotten alternate paths to reach the furthest end of the catacombs. My true dread is in exploring the deepest foundations. I am no stranger to death. I have combed over battlefields and waded through blood and gore to recover the brave heroes lost in combat. However, this secret place where the bones of cursed and nameless damned are banished makes my skin crawl and my soul scream. With every step I wish to turn and flee from this unholy place.{^n}{^n}I have long proposed that keeping the remains of so many wicked men in one location is unwise, but thus far my voiced concerns have been dismissed. Criminals, witches, heretics, cursed, murderers and the insane have been secreted away down here. I can feel their malignant souls heavy upon the air drowning us in their combined guilt; pushing the crumbling walls until they buckle; calling to the dark hollows of the earth; imploring vile things to seek this prison and release the centuries of evil that is trapped within.{^n}{^n}I have discovered a great tear that has opened up beneath the catacombs. Several support walls have collapsed and fallen into the darkness below. There are scratches on the floor and walls as if something scored the very stone. I have also found bones with strange markings on them, as if gnawed by an animal. And lately I've been hearing sounds coming from the walls, as if something was skulking in the darkness nearby. Some wretched thing gliding along the shadows staying just outside the light. My worst fears have come to pass. I must flee and warn the others.{^n}{^n}Caretaker of the Dead, Aleister Pencroft

tagLoreObj_AreaDCatacomb_NoteA01Name=Loose Ends
tagLoreObj_AreaDCatacomb_NoteA01Text=Deceived. Stuck down here in the dark like a rat in a trap. I write these words so I might have vengeance. It's unlikely that this will be found but, if someone reads this, know that Malvek Brevele is a traitorous cur.{^n}{^n}I am Nazahn Untraze. I am a foreigner to these lands, and unashamed to say that I am both a thief and assassin. I tell you this now so you know that I am truthful in my later words. I have been in the secret employ of a wealthy noble, one Malvek Brevele. Most of my work for him was stealing key pieces of information and material for leverage. I have slit the throats of no less than three of his rivals or their agents. I broke into in the chambers of the man above Malvek and placed certain evidence. This resulted in the man's arrest allowing Malvek to move into his position of power. None of this is new. Same things happen with wealthy men and scheming nobility the world over.{^n}{^n}More recently, he bade me to recover an ancestral artifact from his father's tomb. The family Signet Ring. A thing that should not have been buried he says. But the argument between father and son led to rash decisions. I care not for the reason, his coin was always good, but I say nothing and let him speak. He went on to say "The tomb is lavished in my family's vast wealth of the ages. Touch nothing. I am not paying you to plunder my ancestor's tomb. You are only to recover my father's signet ring and return. And make sure you carry a torch. Seldom a light escapes those depths. Do not dare return without the Signet".{^n}{^n}I found the entrance easy enough but it just revealed stairs into blackness. After lighting a torch, I descended into the tomb and wandered these halls for hours, searching for a single name amongst these countless thousands of dead. At last I gave up. But I would not leave empty handed. I was driven to find the wealth Malvek spoke of. I went farther and farther into the darkness. There were some treasures, but nothing of what he hinted at. I pressed on, ignorant of the risk of losing my way back.{^n}{^n}Once the torch started flickering I knew, as if I had planned the betrayal myself. Malvek had played me like a fool. His careful choice of words stung at my pride and ensured that I would be driven to find the Signet despite any risks. And the subtle suggestion to bring a single torch, I was a fool to bring just the one.{^n}{^n}Here I am to stay as I write these final words. Now I see the deception for what it was. Only the elimination of a loose end. My light is done, and so am I.{^n}{^n}Nazahn

tagLoreObj_AreaDSecretPrison_NoteA01Name=Secret Work
tagLoreObj_AreaDSecretPrison_NoteA01Text=Gentlemen,{^n}{^n}I write this report to inform you that after ten years of waiting, the Necropolis project has reached its final depth and we are at last ready to begin the second stage. I have requisitioned slaves, building materials and the rune sealed crates to be shipped to the excavation site. I personally oversaw the transport of each of the deliveries and must inform you of one unfortunate incident.{^n}{^n}A wagon lost a wheel and one of the crates was damaged causing a seal to be broken. This resulted in a leak. The driver insisted on helping and, despite my best attempts to dissuade him from touching the contents, he got some of the leaking ichor on him. I dispatched the poor fool on the spot, a merciful end compared to what that vile fluid would have done to him. I have contained the damage and seen restitutions paid to the man's family. Besides this unfortunate incident, there were no further delays. The remains are safely stored at the bottom of the Necropolis awaiting the completion of the prison.{^n}{^n}I have presented your documentation to the old Architect in charge of the construction and, while he protested, he did not stand in the way of the Imperial writ. However, in the few months since I have been here, he has insisted upon reviewing what it is that we are doing to "his great work" as he keeps calling it. I have expressed the lack of wisdom and safety of this course, but he persists. Hemal Listari has a family, which might be a source of leverage to force him to leave well enough alone. Unfortunately, I fear his curiosity may force us to take drastic measures before this project is finished.{^n}{^n}Vestiaris, Imperial Arcanist

tagLoreObj_AreaDSecretPrison_NoteA02Text=They promised us freedom. Freedom in exchange for ten long years of back-breaking labor. But I now know that we are all going to die in this place. Last night, while we slept, they took all the tools and the food. The entrance to the chamber is now solid rock and buzzes with an unearthly hum as if a swarm of wasps were inside.{^n}{^n}We have been sealed in this horrible place with nothing but these rune-covered crates. There is a putrid moisture to them that bites at the back of your nostrils. I can't stare at the writing on them for too long. They burn the eyes and blur the vision. I don't think we should open them, but the others are starting to get hungry and hoping there is food inside. I know there isn't any. Every muscle in my body is telling me to get as far from those crates as possible. The runes marking them are the same as those we were ordered to carve into the walls of this chamber.{^n}{^n}I believe this is a prison of some kind, built to hold whatever is slowly oozing out of those containers; and now we are trapped in here with it. I may have been on the losing side of the war, had to watch many of my comrades die on the battlefield. But this? This is no way for a man to die.

He is smiling and happy as he tells us that we should reach the mountain in a few days. It's sad to leave our home but I am hopeful for a better life far away from the dangers that seem to be ever increasing here in the north.{^n}{^n}Day 4: Silvie is so happy, running along the side of the wagon picking flowers. I was really worried about her being unhappy as we left behind the only home she has ever known. The wonder and splendor that is youth. It warms my heart.{^n}{^n}Day 6: The mountains are looming ahead of us and the cold is getting sharp. I can see the worry in John's face as he tries to keep up his spirits. I know he only wants to protect us from the dangers and I can only pray that we make it past the mountain before the snow.{^n}{^n}Day 8: We are in the shadow of the mountain now and the days are shorter. Snow has started to fall and the cold came on so suddenly it surprised us. We have warm clothes but the wind cuts right through them.{^n}{^n}Day 11: We have reached a flat at the base of a fort. There are a few other travelers here who have told us the way through to Darkvale is blocked. With our food running low, we were hoping to resupply at the Darkvale Gate Merchant District. Now I don't know what we will do. Turning back is not an option with the snow coming down so fast. John says he is going to talk to the others soon.{^n}{^n}Day 16: The horse died today. John is saddened by this but at least it will feed us until help arrives. I hate that we had to make this trip with Silvie. She is only nine and I don't like the way the other men at the camp look at her.{^n}{^n}Day 22: All of our horse meat is gone. It would have lasted longer if we didn't have to share it with the others. But John said things could have gone badly if we did not. I don't like thinking about what he meant by that.

I can't believe that it doesn't shame me to say I have been eating bugs when I can find them. When I got back to the camp I found that John had killed a man that attacked our daughter.{^n}{^n}Day 29: John has brought Silvie and me a small portion of meat. I don't ask where he got it.{^n}{^n}Day 30: The other men asked what happened to their friend. John told them that he tried to hurt our little girl and offered them some freshly cut meat. They took it without another word and left us alone. Does friendship mean so little in these times?{^n}{^n}Day 36: John offered Silvie to one of the men in the camp. When the man came into the tent to make his advance, John killed him in front of Silvie and me. I am so hungry I don't even care.{^n}{^n}Day ??: It's so hard to write. Numb fingers and the cold dulls my thoughts. The dark of the mountain makes it easy to lose track of the days.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Another man has been lured to our tent. An exchange of food for the promise of warmth. They must know that it's a trap. Maybe they are ready to die. They lie to themselves even as they walk into the butcher's blade.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Our next visitor was wise to the attack. John killed him but not without suffering a terrible wound. He is not sure he will survive the night. I find that I don't care as much as I should. All I see is a potential meal.  Gods, what is happening to me?{^n}{^n}Day??

tagLoreObj_AreaDNecropolis_NoteA01Text=I have been commissioned to construct a grand mausoleum that will house the thousands of dead from the great battle with the west. This will be my Magnum Opus. The project will take many decades and at my age it is unlikely that I will live to see its completion.{^n}{^n}I have begun drafting the plans in my head. The main tomb will be centered around a vast well, which will house most of the fallen. The quantity of earth we will need to move is staggering, but it will serve as a foundation for the rest of the city of the dead. While this is being done, a small army of civil servants will be carefully collecting the bodies, crafting notices of identification, and preparing them for temporary burial. It will be many years before the fallen receive their proper burial.{^n}{^n}We have started construction of temporary mass grave structures to hold them. Some of the families have insisted that they take the remains to which I have no objection but I cannot imagine why they would not want their loved ones to be honored here, at the site of their glorious victory. I should note that the bodies of the enemy will be shipped back to their border and left for them to do with as they please. I mean no disrespect to their fallen but, quite frankly, they are not our problem.{^n}{^n}There are thousands of workers being commissioned for the digging, hauling and carving of the stone. Where Erulan found so many able-bodied and willing workers so quickly is obvious. Slaves. Brought from the imperial prison mines, or enemy soldiers from the war.  Distasteful, but there is too much work to get done to be timid about this.{^n}{^n}So many things to consider and prepare. I am eager to get started. I can only hope that my wife and son will be happy here. It won't be much more than a mining town for a few years, but the work is too important to leave to any other.{^n}{^n}The Grand Architect, Hemal Listari

Though I can't say it has been without complications.{^n}{^n}I was shocked when an agent of the Erulan Imperium appeared and began reassigning workers and equipment without my approval. Apparently the Imperium is having an additional chamber constructed beneath my original designs. These imbeciles have no sense of grandeur and design. This is my life's work we are talking about! I don't care how much the Imperium is paying me. I will not stand for it.{^n}{^n}Over the last seven months, I have written several distasteful letters to the Erulan council stating my displeasure with these arrangements. Not a single response. Every time I see that wretched man, Vestiaris, I confront him on the subject; and every time he gives me the same tired response: "I have been appointed by the Erulan Imperium. If you take issue with my duties here, please take it up with them". Well they can ignore me all they want. This is my vision and I will not be pushed aside as it is befouled. I don't care how long it takes. I will find out what they are doing down there and I will put an end to it.{^n}{^n}The Grand Architect, Hemal Listari

It is of great misfortune that he did not live to see his final work completed, having suddenly passed away mere days ago. It haunts me how strong and healthy he was to die as suddenly as he did. I am deeply saddened, and yet filled with pride and happiness that I was handed the honor of finishing his grand designs. The Imperium has agreed to have him entombed here, a great honor to our family name to be at rest with so many valiant defenders of our great nation.{^n}{^n}As for myself, I am designing my father's mausoleum and then I must leave for my next commission.

tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA01Text=Commander Lucius ordered a scouting mission to the North. When I asked what we should be looking for, he almost lost his temper and said "Anything that might cause a disturbance". His reaction seemed rather out of place and strange. The commander is not known for such outbursts. It also struck me odd the way he used the word "disturbance".{^n}{^n}I took my scouting squad through the north gate and almost immediately started seeing some Aetherial activity.  We changed our course and headed for the hills rather than traveling the main road. It took longer but we avoided large numbers of the Aetherial dead. They appear to be gathering in the north in preparation for an attack. Their numbers have swelled tremendously since my last mission outside the walls. The return trip is going to prove difficult. I sent one of my scouts back to report this information immediately.{^n}{^n}Heading north we passed by the Necropolis. From the mountain top we did not see anything unusual. Searching as far as we could on our resources we discovered nothing but the accursed blood cultists everywhere.  Avoiding them made our progress slow. We did see one strange thing of note: the cultists appear to be collecting blood in vast quantities and hauling them in wagons filled with large glass cisterns. We followed for a bit to see where they were being taken, but were spotted and forced to retreat.{^n}{^n}1st Regimental Scouts of Black Legion, Sergeant Matius Castalan

tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA02Text=After the explosion that destroyed the armory I went back over this past week's reports and compiled this collection of excerpts which I found to be relevant. They are pulled together and arranged in order the events took place. I do this in hopes that it will illuminate how this has happened and raise the questions of what might be done to avoid future attacks like this. That is assuming we survive.{^n}{^n}-Captain Frederick Bachknell{^n}{^n}Report 1: Report from the North Wall Night-Watch: While patrolling the upper wall I witnessed a soldier enter the armory. I would not make note of it except that he appeared to have been looking around the courtyard to make sure none could see him as he entered the gated door. The torches were out in that area of the courtyard so it's impossible for me to say who it was.{^n}{^n}Report 2: Report from the Officer of the Watch: Several men have gone missing and we suspect that they have deserted. A complete search of the Fort and surrounding areas has ended with no sign of them however. The scouts have found no sign of tracks and have concluded the men never left the Fort.{^n}{^n}Report 3: Report from the Master of Arms: I have discovered ten small casks and five large casks of blackpowder missing. It is difficult to account for the missing supplies since only five people in the entire fort have access to the keys that would open the blackpowder storage. Commander Lucius headed the search himself after receiving the worrying report, starting from the bottom levels all the way to the top of the towers. Nothing was found.

tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA03Name=Armory Explosion Investigation
tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA03codexTitle=Armory Explosion
tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA03Text=This is my final report on the massive explosion that has destroyed the north courtyard. It is intended to be read with the compiled notes pulled together from the past week.{^n}{^n}With the intent of establishing a damage report and the death toll, I assembled a squad of soldiers and led them into the shattered depths below Fort Ikon. The explosion appears to have blown down into the sewers making the smell in the armory ungodly. That, in and of itself, has made it almost impossible to go down there. The plumes of smoke reduced our vision and choked the air. Crumbling walls, supports and floors were in constant danger of additional collapse. The explosion appears to have been centered on a single large support below the armory. At the bottom of the devastation we found several dead men, charred almost beyond recognition. They appear to be the men who went missing earlier this week.{^n}{^n}My investigation indicates that the missing men were using the stolen blackpowder to make an opening into the sewers to make their escape. In closing of this report, I'd like to raise two concerns. The first is: one of the men was an explosives expert and should have been aware of the destructive potential of so much powder. By itself, I wouldn't give this detail a second thought, if not for my second concern: another of the men has been with the Black Legion for nearly eight years with no signs of dissent or disagreement with command. In fact, he was due for promotion to a commanding position soon. Something doesn't fit here. The tale that is painted indicates sabotage from within, but who would go to such lengths to frame these men? Without more information, I cannot say with certainty what is going on, but my gut tells me that there is more at play here than at first appears.{^n}{^n}Captain Frederick Bachknell

tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA04Name=Untitled Letter
tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA04Text=I have successfully infiltrated the fort, as you commanded. It is ironic that the commander of this garrison is one of the weakest minds I have ever encountered. There is so much turmoil and fear that resides within him, he was easy to manipulate and overwhelm. While I do have full control of his body, there is something in the region that tampers with direct communication, something tainted and ancient. Anything capable of such an act demands further investigation. I write this correspondence in the meantime, so that another may look into this matter.{^n}{^n}Fort Ikon has proven to be a challenge for us, and now I understand why. The vast stores of weapons and warmachines the humans have amassed is staggering. It is a wonder that they have not exterminated themselves in their endless pursuit of warfare and self-destruction. Nevertheless, everything moves according to our grand plans. I have already taken steps to sabotage their armory and planted evidence leading to several deserters. Nobody suspects my involvement.{^n}{^n}But the main reason I have deemed it necessary to report to you comes from a most unexpected discovery. The anomaly, the revealer of secrets, walks among these humans and even now shares with them our plans. We have since adjusted our projections in this region, ensuring that anything the anomaly reveals is of no use to the humans, but its knowledge of our ways could still prove detrimental to our success on this world. For now, I have begun sowing the seeds of distrust about the anomaly to the humans, their fear is so great that they had it moved to the prison, where it remains. Once my sabotage is complete and the gates are open, Fort Ikon will fall. Then we can deal with the traitor as is fitting of such unprecedented betrayal.

That I was a part of something greater than myself.{^n}{^n}Now that I stand in the halls of this mighty place, I feel the eyes of all those that gave up their lives: the Leaders, the great heroes and the countless thousands who followed them. They fought so that we could live without fear of the nameless fiends which I now serve. I can feel the honor and sacrifice of my ancestors and I am ashamed. Ashamed because of the terrors I have left in my path.{^n}{^n}For months I have done the most vile and unspeakable things.

Blood that belongs to those who I have killed in its name.{^n}{^n}The blood soaked foundation of this forgotten battleground have peeled away the fear and awoken me. There is no forgiving what I have done, no punishment that will ever make it right.
