卡德里斯 死亡印记
干得漂亮。血荆棘的故事算是到头了。
并没有那么困难。
继续前行，为了黑色军团的大业。
再见。
你回来了，或许还带着些伤痕。
血荆棘已经不存在了。
干得好！那个恐怖野兽的死将加速这个地区恢复秩序的进度，我的长官会很高兴听到这件事的，我敢保证。
很高兴我能够帮忙。
猎杀血荆棘的事情进行如何？
我该去哪里寻找这头野兽？
我追它追到了营地东南方向的幽暗盆地，然后它就不见了。它可能葬在那边的某个洞穴里。
好的，我这就去猎杀它。
我还在猎杀它。
This one's a hunt I've been personally struggling with. Local stories speak of an ancient thorner horror known as Ol' Bloodbriar. As it turns out, some of the stories are true and Ol' Bloodbriar's been reported terrorizing the farmers in Homestead.

I've managed to find some tracks, but I lost them out in the Shaded Basin to south. It might be hiding out in one of the caves out there, but I can't be sure. If you hunt down Ol' Bloodbria, I will see that my superiors back in Homestead hear about your contributions. Heck, I'll throw in a few coins as a bounty.
I'll hunt down your beast.
I'm not interested in hunting.
You're in luck, I've slain the crimson thorned horror.

Any luck with the manticores?
I have the venom you need.
Well I'll be, that gland is bulging with venom, a fine sample. As promised, a manticore blade of your own. Should serve you well against less...friendly humans, and hopefully chthonians.

Say, you seem to be quite capable. if you're interested in some coin, I've got a hunt I could use some assistance with.
What are you after?

Any luck with the manticores?
Where should I look?
The manticores roam the Jagged Waste to the west of here. Be careful out there. I need the poison in one of their glands, not in your veins.
I'll be careful.
Haven't dealt with a Wastestalker yet.
You must be one tough slith to make it way out here on your own. Deathmark Kadris, of the Black Legion. What brings you here, citizen?
I'm exploring the area.
I see. Well I can't stop you from going out there, but I must warn you that the wilds out here are not to be trifled with. The Jagged Waste to the west is full of manticores, but if you're foolish enough to venture there then perhaps you'd be willing to bring something back for me?
Sure, what do you need?
The Manticore Wastestalkers pack a potent venom up in their barbed tails. It's quite caustic and can burn through nearly anything. My hope is that the Legion can use it in their effort against the Chthonian invaders.

We are dealing with a large group of cultists up near Homestead, and they are starting to bring in the larger demons from the void. We need to turn the tide and fast, or soon there won't be a home to defend. If you bring me back a venom gland from a Wastestalker, then I will gladly provide you with a blade specially coated with their poison. Should do some serious damage in a fight. What do you say?
I will get you the venom.
No thanks, sounds dangerous.
Actually, I've already gathered some manticore venom.

Not interested.
What are you doing out here?
My squad's been deployed out here to the Pine Barrens in order to hunt down the dangerous wildlife roaming outside of Homestead. It's a gruelling process, but someone's gotta do it.
Need any help?

Good luck out there.
Citizen? Hasn't the empire fallen?
As long as the Black Legion has at least one soul still breathing, that battle is not over as far as I'm concerned.

We may have lost the capital, but we have not lost the war!
Need any help?

You are naive.
The Black Legion?
Um, yes? The Imperial Elite? The Conquerors of Venmar? You must be from the rural country.

They didn't know much about us at Homestead either.
Where is Homestead?
Is that where you're headed? You are going the wrong way, friend.

Homestead is far to the north of here. Follow the Dusty Road.
Thanks.

Goodbye.
Just passing through.
