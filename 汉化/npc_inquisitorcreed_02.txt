审判官克里德
Though the situation is dire, we must remain hopeful.{^n}{^n}We're counting on you. 
I...misplaced Ulgrim's Keepsake. 
You cannot be serious. How many of these do you think Ulgrim kept around? Don't answer that...{^n}{^n}Please be more careful with this one. 
Thank you. I'll be more careful. 
I...misplaced your pendant. 
I'm not sure I heard you correctly when you said you lost a precious Luminari relic that only a handful of inquisitors ever even had access to.{^n}{^n}Be more careful. 
Thank you. I'll be more careful. 
This keepsake of Ulgrim's... 
I know, it doesn't seem like much, but this is one of only a few things Ulgrim dragged around everywhere he went.{^n}{^n}It clearly had sentimental value, something the witches can use to divine his whereabouts, if he still lives... 
 
I suppose it's the best we've got. 
Why is finding Ulgrim so damn important? 
There's a lot to Ulgrim that you don't know about, that none of us know about.{^n}{^n}He seems more than human and I suspect has been walking this world for a lot longer than you and I combined. He could become a devastating weapon of the Chthonians if we allow them to corrupt his mind.{^n}{^n}Maybe there is some degree of comradery influencing my thinking but I do feel that he could become a threat if we leave him to be consumed by the madness of the void. 
Farewell. 
Farewell.
Show me the events that transpired here again. (Play Intro)
Even here, in our last stronghold, the enemy has found a way to wreak havoc.{^n}{^n}Nevertheless, we must stand united or face complete annihilation. 
We'll deal with it, one challenge at a time. 
Good, you're back.{^n}{^n}We have other matters to discuss immediately. 
Sure, what is it? 
I struggle to admit this, but I must abandon my efforts at opening a rift to reach Ulgrim. For all I've learned in battling the occult, I'm no Warlock. During my last attempt, I nearly lost control of the ritual when something tried to breach my portal from the other side. This is too dangerous to continue. {^n}{^n}To make matters worse, Captain Bourbon has just arrived with a girl named Amala, bearing dire news from the east. While we struggled here to stop the Chthonians from unleashing terror and madness upon the world, the Aetherials have been far from idle. Everything they had done in this region is merely a sample of what is to come if what Amala says is true.{^n}{^n}As much as it pains me to say this, our plans to rescue Ulgrim are secondary to this rising threat in the fallen city of Malmouth. The passage north from Burrwitch is quickly closing as the Aetherfire consumes everything. But perhaps we can accomplish both goals at once. 
What do you have in mind? 
You see, the Luminari have long been aware of a coven of witches hiding out to the north of Burrwitch, using the treacherous territory to deter pursuers. The witches will know the lay of the land and should be aware of any paths that remain through the Aetherfire.{^n}{^n}And...I have hopes that they will be able to do what I could not: reveal where the Loghorrean has taken Ulgrim. I would go myself, but I doubt the arrival of a high ranking inquisitor will be looked upon kindly within their circle, and I am needed in Devil's Crossing.{^n}{^n}I know that you have suffered much already in the defense of humanity, but you are the only one I can trust with this. Take my pendant and travel north from the Burrwitch Estates. A barrier of aetherfire will stand in your way, but the pendant will make short work of it.Head north through Gloomwald until you've reached the edges of Ugdenbog, where I believe the coven has made their home. You cannot arrive empty-handed or they may well burn any memory of discovering their location right out of your mind.{^n}{^n}I recommend you hunt down a creature known as Caraxxus Foul, the Scourge of Ugdenbog. I imagine it has grown quite large over the years, preying on unwary travelers making their way through Gloomwald. Find the beast within its waterside lair in Gloomwald and bring its heart to the coven. I'm sure they'll find some nefarious use for it, but we must overlook that in light of our situation.{^n} {^n}Show them this keepsake of Ulgrim's and find us a way to Malmouth. We will be awaiting your signal. 
I'll head to Ugdenbog right away. 
I need some time to prepare. 
 
I'll return soon. 
Sorry, I'll be right back. 
Show me the events that transpired here again. (Play Intro)
We have no time to rest. Humanity's survival depends upon our vigilance.{^n}{^n}We have other matters to discuss.
How can I help? 
I'll be back.
I heard back from Captain Bourbon.{^n}{^n}I'm pleased to hear that Warden Krieg has been dealt with. He was a despicable creature. I only wish I had been more prepared when I met him myself. 
He was a menace, but it is finished. 
Indeed, but while one matter is closed, another begins. We have no time to rest. Humanity's survival depends upon our vigilance.{^n}{^n}We have other matters to discuss. 
How can I help?
I'll be back. 
How go your efforts in Devil's Crossing.{^n}{^n}With so few of us remaining, every settlement counts. 
What do I need to do again? 
Head back to Devil's Crossing and assist Captain Bourbon with anything he needs.{^n}{^n}We can't simply allow the Aetherials in that region to spread their influence unopposed. 
I'll be off then. 
Still much left to do. 
Good, you're back.{^n}{^n}Do you have a moment? 
Sure, what is it? 
I struggle to admit this, but I must abandon my efforts at opening a rift to reach Ulgrim. For all I've learned in battling the occult, I'm no Warlock.

I'll head to Ugdenbog right away. 
I need some time to prepare. 
I have some questions. 
Make it quick. We depart for Devil's Crossing as soon as possible. 
Why is finding Ulgrim so damn important? 
There's a lot to Ulgrim that you don't know about, that none of us know about.{^n}{^n}He seems more than human and I suspect has been walking this world for a lot longer than you and I combined.

I need some time to think. 
I'm going to destroy a barrier...with a pendant? 
It may not look like much, but that pendant has helped me out of many a tricky situation, including my ordeal with Warden Krieg.{^n}{^n}Trust me, it is inscribed with powerful Luminari runes. Throw it into the barrier and it will do the rest. 
What's the situation again? 
 
I have another question. 
I need some time to think. 
What can I expect out there? 
The road north from Burrwitch has never been pleasant, passing through the treacherous Gloomwald and Ugdenbog.{^n}{^n}Between the toxic plant life and murky waters housing some of Cairn's most dangerous beasts, beyond the established road it's an inhospitable hell, but that is precisely why the Coven chose to hide out there. No one would willingly venture into those untamed lands, so the Coven was isolated and left in peace.{^n} 
 
I have another question. 
I need some time to think. 
What happened in Malmouth? 
Amala can give you a more up to date explanation, but Malmouth was one of the first cities to fall to the Aetherials when the Grim Dawn occurred.{^n}{^n}Ulgrim passed through there on the way south when we split up at the capital and his reports were as depressing as you would expect. We had believed Malmouth to be a lost cause, completely overrun by the enemy and devoid of survivors, but Amala here is a testament to humanity's resilience and evidence that the fight for Malmouth is not yet over. 
 
I have another question. 
I need some time to think. 
Is there no other way to Malmouth? 
Used to be you could travel across the lake, but with the waters full of eldritch monstrosities and intact ships in short supply, we do not have the capabilities to send that many soldiers up to Malmouth via the water. Better to encounter foes on land that we have a chance against than to find ourselves at the mercy of whatever lurks beneath the depths of the lake. It's not a risk I'd want to take.{^n}{^n}We will have to follow the roads from Burrwitch, or perhaps travel via riftgate if you manage to secure one. I'm counting on you. 
 
I have another question. 
I need some time to think. 
How can we be sure the Coven still exists? 
Ulgrim shared with me some of what he saw on his journey to Devil's Crossing. {^n}{^n}Though he was sparing on details, he did mention that some of the Coven survived the Grim Dawn. He had suggested we try to ally with them earlier but I was relucatant until now. 
 
I have another question. 
I need some time to think. 
Actually, forget it. 
I'll return soon. 
Show me the events that transpired here again. (Play Intro)
I'll return soon.
Show me the events that transpired here again. (Play Intro)
And so our great moment of triumph is soured with tragedy.{^n}{^n}The cult's defeat at the Necropolis marks humanity's first major victory in this conflict, proving that we are not going to simply lie down and let ourselves be wiped out by fiends and spirits. Word of this victory will spread and give people hope that someday this nightmare will truly be over.{^n}{^n}Yet we cannot forget those who sacrificed their lives to bring us here. Brave men and women of the Black Legion who took up arms in the defense of Erulan, a nation that scorned them as criminals, outcasts and even traitors. In death, they were none of those things. They died as heroes.{^n}{^n}But I refuse to count Ulgrim among the dead just yet. I owe him that much.{^n}{^n}I could use your help. Are you with me?
Sure, what can I do?
I have some questions.
Yes?
What about the Aetherials?
They are as much a threat as ever. Much of the empire is still under their control.{^n}{^n}We must be prepared for an extended conflict. It may be years before we even breach the capital, much less expel the Aetherials from Cairn.
What about Ulgrim?
I have another question.
Farewell.
The Cult is still out there. Shouldn't we stop them for good?
Your actions at the Necropolis have severely crippled their activities.{^n}{^n}It will likely be some time before we have to deal with their ilk again.{^n}{^n}For now, we must see to strengthening our defenses.
What about Ulgrim?
I have another question.
Farewell.
Did you know that Anasteria is an Aetherial?
I had my suspicions, but...she has put us all in a rather difficult place.{^n}{^n}I can't say that I fully trust her, but she has been useful in fighting against her own people, at least until recently when her information has gotten spotty at best.{^n}{^n}I suspect that the Aetherial have become wise to her dealings with us and had adjusted their plans to foil her information.{^n}{^n}Nevertheless, her knowledge has helped save countless human lives, and she still knows more about the Aetherials than any of us. For that alone she is still useful.
What about Ulgrim?
I have another question.
Farewell.
I...need some time.
You're just going to end up killed.
Good, you're back.{^n}{^n}Do you have a moment?
Sure, what is it? 
While I look into Ulgrim's situation, something has come up that you may want to hear.{^n}{^n}The settlement you came from, Devil's Crossing, has requested assistance with the Aetherials pouring out of Burrwitch. We can't just leave those people to die. Since you've dealt with Captain Bourbon before, I figured you could handle this one personally.{^n}{^n}Please go back to Devil's Crossing and help bring down this Aetherial threat by any means necessary. 
I'm on it. 
I can't right now. 
You've returned. Is it finished then? 
The beast has been banished, but Ulgrim was pulled into the Void along with it. 
And so our great moment of triumph is soured with tragedy.{^n}{^n}The cult's defeat at the Necropolis marks humanity's first major victory in this conflict, proving that we are not going to simply lie down and let ourselves be wiped out by fiends and spirits. Word of this victory will spread and give people hope that someday this nightmare will truly be over.{^n}{^n}Yet we cannot forget those who sacrificed their lives to bring us here. Brave men and women of the Black Legion who took up arms in the defense of Erulan, a nation that scorned them as criminals, outcasts and even traitors. In death, they were none of those things. They died as heroes.{^n}{^n}But I refuse to count Ulgrim among the dead just yet. I owe him that much.{^n}{^n}I could use your help. Are you with me? 
How can I help?
What can we do? 
我有一些问题。
什么问题？
虚灵怎么样了？
他们和以前一样颇具威胁。帝国的大部分区域都在他们的控制之下。{^n}{^n}我们必须准备好进行长期的斗争。我们或许得花上数年来攻下首都，更别说将虚灵驱逐出凯恩了。
What about Ulgrim? 
What about Ulgrim? 
我还有个问题。
再见。
邪教仍然很猖獗。我们难道不该制止他们吗？
你在大墓地的行动已经很好的削弱了他们。{^n}{^n}我们得过段时间再来解决这帮家伙了。{^n}{^n}目前我们必须注意加强防御。+
What about Ulgrim?
What about Ulgrim?
我还有个问题。
我明白了。
你知道安娜斯特瑞娅是一名虚灵吗？
我的确有些怀疑，但是...她将我们置于了相当危险的境地。{^n}{^n}我不能说完全相信她，但在和她自己阵营的战斗中，她帮了很多的忙，至少最近来看她提供的信息有对有错。{^n}{^n}我猜测虚灵已经察觉到了她和我们的交易并调整了他们的计划来扰乱她的信息。{^n}{^n}不过，她的学识已经帮我们拯救了无数的生命，并且比我们中的任何人都要了解虚灵。单单这个原因，她就仍然很有作用。
What about Ulgrim?
What about Ulgrim?
我还有个问题。
有道理。
没关系。
I...need some time. 
You're just going to end up killed. 
我听说了你对安娜斯特瑞娅的所做所为。{^n}{^n}你的鲁莽行径浪费了一个珍贵的资源。
她是个虚灵女巫！
就算那是真的，也不能否认她正在帮助我们。{^n}{^n}她的消息帮助我们避开了虚灵的数次致命攻击。敌人花了几个月的时间才发现信息泄漏了出去。{^n}{^n}安娜斯特瑞娅拯救了无数生命。然而我们杀了她作为回报。
我不知道该说什么。
或许你在行动之前已经考虑过了。
我很抱歉。
我还是支持自己的行为。
她仍然是个威胁。
我做了你明令禁止的事情。
你需要了解些什么？
我们需要你在那里帮忙。
也许吧，但必须有人协调我们的力量，圣像堡仍然暴露在敌人目光之下。
有道理。

再见。
你还在这里做什么？艾格瑞姆在大墓地需要你的帮助！

我现在就过去。
你保护好传送门了吗？
大墓地在哪？
从圣像堡的正门出去并越过征战平原，前往大墓地的门就在不远处。{^n}{^n}一旦到达那里，找到一个传送门并保护它，这样我们的部队就能向邪教进发。
谢谢。
我有一些问题。
什么问题？
谁是安娜斯特瑞娅？
安娜斯特瑞娅？你为什么问这个...
瑞弗队长提到了她。
啊，这下我明白了。{^n}{^n}你只需要知道，不管瑞弗队长说了些什么，安娜斯特瑞娅都是一个有价值的盟友。她对虚化力量的学识已经帮我们救了很多生命。{^n}{^n}不管瑞弗队长要你做什么，都不要去伤害安娜斯特瑞娅。
我还有个问题。
很好。
我听见有人提到了她的名字。
安娜斯特瑞娅为我们提供了对虚化能量的无价知识。{^n}{^n}不管军队里的人说了些什么，安娜斯特瑞娅都是我们的盟友，并且不能受到伤害。
我还有个问题。
我明白了。
我还有个问题。
没事了。
我们对罗格霍瑞恩有什么了解？
很不幸，所知甚少。我们知道罗格霍瑞恩曾经被召唤到凯恩过，大概是导致建造大墓地的那场大屠杀时期。{^n}{^n}如果我能获得伊露兰的审判官文献，或许我们可以了解更多。
我还有个问题。
我需要回到那里。
关于大墓地你能告诉我些什么？
大墓地建造于一场规模宏大的在伊露兰与卡瑞尼亚西部国度之间产生的战斗之后。我们如今所在的圣像堡，就是伊露兰最终在战斗中征服了对手的地方，这里是个埋葬了成千上万人生命的屠宰场。{^n}{^n}在那场战斗中牺牲的英雄们据说被埋在了大墓地中，那是为了纪念伟大的胜利。{^n}{^n}而现在发现大墓地的建造似乎有着更深层次的目的。
我还有个问题。
我得返回那里了。
你知道安娜斯特瑞娅是一名虚灵吗？

我还有个问题。
没关系。
我会注意的。
卢修斯的事情你处理的很好，但大墓地在等待着我们。
你要我去哪？
我们不能直接让部队开进大墓地。邪教的仆从们会对我们进行大肆围攻，那样的话我们在接近守望者之墓的时候已经损失惨重了。{^n}{^n}我们会很好的利用你的特殊技能来代替正面冲突。潜入大墓地，穿过征战平原，保护好最近的传送门。{^n}{^n}一旦你完成了，艾格瑞姆就会带着人与你汇合。我们要从内部出其不意的打击敌人。
我立刻前往大墓地。
我需要一点时间做准备。
我已经保卫了传送门。
想的真快。我会立刻派出先遣队前往那里。{^n}{^n}返回那里并和艾格瑞姆交谈。我们会告诉你接下来该怎么做。
我会去与他们汇合的。
我有一些问题。
有话快说。
谁是安娜斯特瑞娅？
安娜斯特瑞娅？你为什么问这个...
瑞弗队长提到了她。
啊，这下我明白了。{^n}{^n}你只需要知道，不管瑞弗队长说了些什么，安娜斯特瑞娅都是一个有价值的盟友。她对虚化力量的学识已经帮我们救了很多生命。{^n}{^n}不管瑞弗队长要你做什么，都不要去伤害安娜斯特瑞娅。
好的。你需要我做些什么？

我还有个问题。
我很快回来。
干的好。{^n}{^n}我们必须立刻清理出一条安全的通路。
你想让我去哪？

你取回炸药了吗？
军械库在哪？
军械库在圣像堡的北部区域。赶紧去！
我立刻过去。
还没有。
背叛，或者阴谋，随便你怎么说。我们从内部遭受了攻击。{^n}{^n}虚灵似乎控制了指挥官。
他被控制了？
这很明显。根据报告，指挥官卢修斯曾经派遣我们的人去做些无用功的事情，使得堡垒的防御变弱。之后，等到盯梢弱到一定程度，他就打开了大门让虚灵大批的涌入。{^n}{^n}但他低估了人类的应变能力。武器大师艾德里克用炸药将大门炸塌了，阻断了敌人的兵力。在我们与来自南方的增援部队汇合后，懦弱的卢修斯逃进了军械库。直到清理完其他大门，我们在这里受阻了。我需要你进入军械库并取回剩下的炸药；用它们来清理碎石。但要当心卢修斯。他已经卸下了人类的伪装并用一个我无法用语言形容的怪物形体取代了他。你很可能要先解决他才能得到炸药。
我会杀了他的。
再等等。
我已经杀了卢修斯并清理了大门。
干得好。{^n}{^n}我们得清理出一条通往大墓地的道路。
你想让我去哪？

我已经解决了卢修斯。
那就不要再浪费时间了。把炸药带去正门并清理碎石以便军团能向大墓地进军。
我会去做的。
很好，你来了。{^n}{^n}这里的事情比我想的更糟。
发生了什么事情？

甚至在这里，我们最后的堡垒中，敌人都能找到方法进行严重破坏。{^n}{^n}我们必须联合起来，团结一致，否则只能面临灭亡。
我们会处理好它的，每次都有新的挑战。
