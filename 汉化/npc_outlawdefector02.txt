“刀子” 弗兰基
希望你能让那个疯子自作自受。

We're getting out of here as soon as the coast is clear.
Get moving.
等等，等一下！We're on your side!

别杀我们。
My side? Why are you in a cage?
The stuff going on out here? That's nothing compared to what's in the mine. Cronley's building himself an army of "ascended" and we want nothing to do with it.

Course, he don't take too kindly to people leaving his little cult. Got caught trying to leave. Now we're awaiting our turn with the Pitmaster. He tears people apart like an animal. I don't want to be here when he gets bored with the guts splattering the arena walls.

你放我们走，我们保证不再作恶。
你们是匪徒，为什么我要放了你们？
Look, um, Cronley's gone off the deep end, crazy with power from those...those green crystals.

I've seen what he does with his inner circle. Takes them to a secret room where he plunges shards into their flesh. That's when I was sure I wanted outta this gig.

我懂了，你是来结束这一切的人。你是一位好人，我可以帮助你的。放我们走，我就告诉你他把大块的水晶藏在了哪儿。然后你就能终结这疯狂的一切了。

我不管，你还是个罪犯。(攻击)
我会给你一个痛快的。(攻击)
你们是匪徒，为什么我要放了你们？
听着，我们不想在跟克隆利有什么关系了。那家伙陷得太深了，他为了那些……那些水晶的力量已经发疯了。

好吧，我在听着呢。
There I thought you were gonna kill us. Alright, so Cronley don't leave the mine much no more. He's too busy creating more of his "ascended".

You're gonna have to get through them before you even see his ugly mug. But if you somehow survive, check behind Cronley's bed. There's a gap in the wall that leads to his little hideout.

That's where Cronley does all his twisted experiments. Wreck the place and nobody's gonna think twice about using those crystals again.
谢谢，赶紧滚吧。
很好，干掉你之后，就轮到克隆利了。(攻击)
我不管，你还是个罪犯。(攻击)
所有匪徒都得死！(攻击他们)
