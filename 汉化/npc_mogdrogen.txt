Avatar of Mogdrogen
It seems that I have underestimated you, mortal. You are strong of body and spirit.{^n}{^n}That's good. You will need it in the trials ahead.
How are you alive?
You have merely slain my avatar, a physical manifestation of myself. Believe me, if you had faced my full manifestation, we would not be having this discussion.{^n}{^n}You cannot kill a god, mortal.
We'll see about that.
So this is just an illusion, interesting.
And don't you forget it.
Don't make that mistake again.
Has your rage cooled, mortal?{^n}{^n}Are you finished with your futile outbursts of violence?

I'm just getting started.
Farewell.
Have you come to pay your respects, mortal?

Farewell.
Come to pay your respects?
May I ask some questions?
Ask.
你是谁或者说你是什么呢？
我是万首之神，大自然的保护者和罗瓦里的守护神。{^n}{^n}你们凡人叫我莫格卓根。
那么其他神呢在哪？至高神呢？
至高神？I have not heard that name uttered in centuries.{^n}{^n}These Chosen that you associate with. I wonder if they truly understand what they have uncovered underneath those ruins.
I have another question.
Faith has guided Father Kymon.
The results of their fervor speak for themselves.
Perhaps they do not.
What about the other gods? What about Uroboruuk?
You would presume that this idol of the death worshippers stands among the gods?{^n}{^n}A laughable suggestion.{^n}{^n}This Uroboruuk is more myth than reality. How do you know he even exists?
I have another question.
I suppose I don't know for sure.
I found proof. Perhaps you do not know everything.
Guardian of the Rhowari?

I have another question.
I...see.
一位神？难道你不应该保护凯恩世界吗？
This is a mere fragment of my presence, an avatar; but more than enough to squash you like the insignificant insect you are.{^n}{^n}So be careful to presume what I should or should not be doing, mortal.
那么为什么神允许恐怖黎明这样的事情发生呢？
Nobody talks to me that way.
你胆敢威胁一位上神? One who was old when this world was but a molten orb?{^n}{^n}Surely your mortal struggles have not brought you before me seeking your own destruction?
Alright then, I'll be going.
管你是不是神，去死吧！ (错误地攻击)
我还有一个问题。
Alright then, I'll be going.
My mistake.
If you are a god, then why did you allow the Grim Dawn to happen?
The wheels set in motion to culminate in what you call the Grim Dawn have been spinning for far longer than your short life.{^n}{^n}Even one such as I could not have foreseen the events that transpired that day.
But why allow the Aetherials and Chthonians to continue?
This world has become just another piece in their brutal conflict.{^n}{^n}To presume that the cycle could be disrupted is the futile wish of a doomed mortal.
但是你的子民们会死！
罗瓦里的命运由我来掌控。{^n}{^n}I do not expect a mortal to comprehend my intentions.


I have another question.
Some god you are...
I guess we will have to handle this ourselves.
So you will do nothing?
It is not for you to presume what I will or will not do, mortal.


I have another question.
Some god you are...
I guess we will have to handle this ourselves.

I have another question.
这算什么回答。
可能你并不像我想象的那般强大。
This may be a mere fragment of my presence, an avatar. But it is more than enough to squash you like the insignificant insect you are.{^n}{^n}Watch your tone with me, mortal.
I have another question.
Alright then, I'll be going.
I apologize.
I have another question.
I see.
Were you mortal once?
An insulting question. Were you not a fool once?
I have another question.
Sorry I asked.
What is your relationship with the Rovers?
The Rhowari are my chosen people.{^n}{^n}It is through them that I shall act out my will in the coming darkness.
The coming darkness?
Be certain of this, mortal: the suffering of your people has only begun.
I have another question.
That's ominous...
Um, great.
How did you convince Rhowan to secede his throne in Arkovia?
An ancient tale, and one I enjoy retelling.{^n}{^n}However, I convinced him of nothing. I saw into his heart and revealed to him the truth he already knew.{^n}{^n}It was Rhowan who had the wisdom to accept my words as nothing less and for that his descendants have my blessing.
You mentioned a coming darkness?
I have another question.
Rhowan sounded like a wise ruler.
Fascinating.
I have another question.
I see.
Nevermind.
Farewell.
You have done the Rhowari a great justice this day, mortal. For this, I thank you.
Is this your shrine?
The shrine was created in my honor, yes. It is one of many, though none suffered the corrupting presence of Ch'thon as this one.{^n}{^n}Your valor shall not go without reward.

Thank you.
Have you come to pay your respects, mortal?
Who are you?
I am the Lord of Beasts, protector of nature, and guardian of the Rhowari.{^n}{^n}Your mortal kind calls me Mogdrogen.
A god? Shouldn't you be protecting Cairn?
A mere fragment of my presence, an avatar. But more than enough to squash you like the insignificant insect you are.{^n}{^n}So watch your tone with me, mortal.
Nobody talks to me that way.
You would threaten a Primordial Being? One who was old when this world was but a molten orb?{^n}{^n}Surely your mortal struggles have not brought you before me seeking your own destruction?
Alright then, I'll be going.
God or not, you die! (Misguidedly Attack)
Alright then, I'll be going.
I...see.
Farewell.
