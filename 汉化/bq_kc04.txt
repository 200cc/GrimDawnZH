Humans twisted by madness and obsessed with devouring dead flesh.{^n}{^n}Now they are little more than mindless fiends, abominations that deserve no pity or remorse. The Black Sepulcher in the 古代墓地 is teeming with these Corpse-eaters. If Cairn is to be cleansed, then they must be eradicated.{^n}{^n}Any such effort shall be rewarded with iron bits.
