Bounty
革翅目象甲虫 are the immature larval stage of the larger specimens.{^n}{^n}Eliminating them should help thin the adult Dermapteran population. They are not all that dangerous individually but take great care. When swarming, they can prove to be just as deadly as the adults.{^n}{^n}Iron bits have been set aside as compensation for this extermination.
