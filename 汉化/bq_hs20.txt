赏金：血之盛宴
赏金
血之盛宴 is a ruthless dranghoul that's been seen rallying the local grobles at a place known as 暴君的要塞.{^n}{^n}Normally, grobles are not much of a threat. They squabble amongst themselves nearly as often as they attack human outposts. But with one such as Bloodfeast leading them, they could pose a serious threat to Homestead.{^n}{^n}Bloodfeast must be slain before that happens. A substantial sum of iron bits to anyone that brings his reign to an end.
