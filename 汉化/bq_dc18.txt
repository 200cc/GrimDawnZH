赏金：Master of the Pit
Bounty
The outlaws inhabiting the Four Hills in 古安克维亚 have a favorite past-time: throwing unarmed prisoners into their pit to face off against Boris.{^n}{^n}Boris is a butcher who revels in the bloodshed. It's sickening.{^n}{^n}Whenever he's about the Four Hills, he can be found in the pit near the coast. Putting him down within his own arena would be a poetic end to the maniac.{^n}{^n}To see this through, 恶魔十字 has prepared a hefty sum of iron bits as compensation for the death of Boris.
