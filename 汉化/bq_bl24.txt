赏金：不朽者 伊尔戈
Bounty
The Legion requests assistance with a priority target.{^n}{^n}Far to the south, within the Broken Hills, there is a forgotten ruin known as 苦痛阶梯. It appears to be the epicenter of all undead activity within Arkovia. At the bottom of this accursed place, beyond the Gates of Anguish, there dwells a corruption known as 伊尔戈. If this guardian were somehow destroyed and the tower cleansed, then the Legion could study the ruins and excavate them for artifacts. Such a valuable resource cannot be underestimated.{^n}{^n}The Legion is willing to share some of its rare materials with anyone that manages to accomplish this impossible task.{^n}{^n}This bounty requires a Skeleton Key.
