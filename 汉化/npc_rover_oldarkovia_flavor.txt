你知道安克维亚就是罗瓦里的诞生地吗？你如果有时间听故事的话，我能给你讲述许多这片土地的过往。
I have found some texts you may find interesting.
That is an astounding discovery. I thank you, in the name of all Rhowari, for bringing these texts to us.

I will make certain that all rovers who visit here learn of their contents.
Farewell.
请讲，我非常有兴趣了解古安克维亚的故事。
The ruins that dot the landscape here were once part of a thriving culture in ancient times. Arkovia prospered by acting as a trade hub between the western lands and the great lake.{^n}{^n}From the little fishing village of New Harbor, which is hardly a harbor at all, the stone pylons of Arkovia's once massive docks can be seen still jutting from the water, the wood long rotted away.

安克维亚是如何陷落的？
Arkovia was a proud city but its people were overly obsessed with war and titles. The nobility constantly maneuvered and plotted against one another, sometimes leading Arkovia into civil war.{^n}{^n}Some seasons, little was planted as the common men from different fiefs were called to arms by lords squabbling with one another. Eventually, society collapsed and a weakened Arkovia became easy prey to outside powers.Provinces were lost and the domain of Arkovia contracted, yet the city itself was never conquered by foreign foes. Its death was far more sinister...

安克维亚的城市中发生了什么？
In the final years, decades after Rhowan, the last king of Arkovia and the father of the Rhowari, abdicated the throne, the great houses came to outright war over the vacant throne.{^n}{^n}Eventually, an Oligarchy formed comprised of the most powerful remaining houses. Each was ever maneuvering and plotting against the others, all believing that if they could only seize power for themselves, they could usher in a new golden era for the city.Their machinations wrought only destruction and misery, hastening Arkovia to its ruin and driving them in turn to pursue desperate measures that brought them ruin on a catastrophic scale. Its weight is still heavy upon this land.


再见。
你提到的死灵法师也在安克维亚的覆灭中扮演了重要的角色？
安克维亚的末日是由于受到了永世的诅咒，而那诅咒正是死灵法师施放的。死灵法术是一项远古的技艺，它在安克维亚早期的历史中十分兴盛。当然那是在它被定义为非法之前的事了。{^n}{^n}死灵法师们被抓捕然后投进了苦痛阶梯的监狱里。在那里他们因为对抗自然的变化而受到惩罚，但是这种黑暗的法术是永远无法被完全消灭的。据说，其中一名被关押的死灵法师从来不会变老，甚至是关了他数十载之后。而且他们还发现以他们的力量怎么也无法杀死他。{^n}{^n}He was known by the name Uroboruuk and his seeming immortality turned against him on the torturer's table. In the end though, he had his vengeance...


再见。
How did this Uroboruuk manage to carry out his vengeance?
As Arkovia waned, the Oligarchs became increasingly desperate and driven to extreme measures.{^n}{^n}When they learned of Uroboruuk and his strange immortality, they were foolishly intrigued. The great houses lusted for the secret knowledge by which they could achieve immortality for their bloodlines and they thought to compel that knowledge from the necromancer.{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk played upon their desires and betrayed them with a false ritual that they were all too eager to believe. The souls of the Akrovians were bound eternally to their cursed city while their mortal flesh decayed.


实在是一个令人毛骨悚然的故事。要是有法子消除这片土地受到的诅咒就好了。
我觉得你似乎有所保留？
是的，我隐瞒了这故事最恐怖的一部分。我本不打算讲出来的，但似乎你执意要了解全部的真相。{^n}{^n}The last part of the tale is of the children birthed after the ritual's magic had taken hold. They entered this world horribly deformed and inhuman. Their feet were said to be clawed and from their backs sprouted diseased plumage, like the feathers of birds who feast upon the dead. Not many venture into the Broken Hills anymore, but those who do say these accursed children of Arkovia have endured and now prey upon travelers who pass through those lands.{^n}{^n}Thus the doom of Arkovia was complete, wiping out the past and future bloodlines of the great houses and cursing these lands to this day.

再见。
我必须继续赶路了。
May your path be true.
再见。
一路平安，小心这片土地上的魂灵。他们阴险狡诈。

我会留心你说的话的。
我们永远欢迎你。



谢谢你，我会记得的。
