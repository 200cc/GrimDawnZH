Kymon's Chosen
Braving the Void
Kill Boss
Father Kymon is impressed with your recent actions against the Cult of Ch'thon, but before you are allowed to receive Empyrion's will from the Blessed Father himself, you must first prove your iron will through a trial-by-fire. Find a chaos rift somewhere in the 血森林 and enter it. Once there, seek out its master, a Chthonian beast known as 梦魇 加戈斯, and destroy it.
