听到那个杀人狂吃了亏，我会睡得更安稳一些。我可能不是个好人，但我是有底线的。克隆利做的事情……实在足以令人感到恶心。
确实如此。
哎，在克隆利拉拢我之前，我是不知道要跟他做什么的。当然，我了解克隆利的名头，我也想通了，自己也干了不少坏事。只是我不清楚Sure, I knew Cronley's reputation but I figured, hey, I done some bad work myself. I just didn't count on how deep his darkness went.{^n}{^n}First I thought... this is a man with some vision, a leader who can cut a cushy life for us here by living fat off the spoils of rovers and the toil of lesser folk. Things just kept getting more twisted though. Cronley's closest men became fanatics, following his every command no matter how depraved or bizarre. They stuck these damned green crystals in their flesh and became freakishly strong. The things he ordered done to folk... sometimes just for sport, I couldn't take it no more.{^n}{^n}He made brutal examples of people who defected in the past but, I figured out a way. You see, I was captured. I didn't really defect. He'll see that... right?
有意思……
