别打扰我，任性的孩子。{^n}{^n}在这儿我受审判官的保护。
好吧。
克里德要我一同远行。{^n}{^n}我会尽我所能帮助粉碎虚灵在马尔茅斯的行动。
你能告诉我有关这里虚灵的事情吗？
I was stationed in the west, my focus and attention upon dismantling the Legion. I was only sent information relevant to my mission, the flow of which ended promptly when concensus was reached regarding a betrayal in the ranks.{^n}{^n}However, I can tell you that Malmouth is under the authority of one Theodin Marcell, but we knew him as the Master of Flesh, the Shaper, the Manipulator.{^n}{^n}He orchestrated the Amalgamation that was intended for Homestead, as well as the annihilation of Port Valbury. Yet Malmouth was to be his greatest accomplishment.
多谢提供这些情报。
这情报用处不大，不过还是谢谢。
再见。
孩子，还有很多比我为何在这里更为重要的事情。{^n}{^n}做你该做的事。
再见。
