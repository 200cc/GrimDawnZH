马尔茅斯
一位妹妹的爱
德拉维斯的踪迹
黛拉Daila has come forward in regards to all of her stories she had been writing. There is more truth to them than the context implies and she is now worried that Dravis, her actual brother, may have stumbled onto something too dangerous to be ignored. She has asked for your help in tracking him down. She knows that Dravis has passed through this area, so she wishes for you to search through the ruins in the Malmouth Outskirts for any clues. Dravis enjoys taunting Daila, so it is likely he left her more clues. If you find anything, return it to Daila in Mourndale, outside Malmouth.
