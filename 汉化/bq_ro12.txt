赏金
Deep within 苦痛阶梯, the Arkovian torture prison, there dwell several ruthless undead beings, chief amongst them Alkamos, the Lord Executioner. But Alkamos had many servants to carry out his decrees.{^n}{^n}Among them was 莫塔里斯, a butcher of men who relished in the gruesome work of the Steps. Should he ever escape from 苦痛阶梯, 莫塔里斯 would bring his hunger for death to the innocents now inhabiting the region. He must be destroyed. We have set aside some of their scavenged materials as reward for this task.
