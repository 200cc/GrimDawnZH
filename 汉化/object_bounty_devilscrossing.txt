Darius Cronley's closest lieutenants are some of the most vicious and deadly men that escaped the prison after 恐怖黎明.{^n}{^n}For now they seem content to remain in the Four Hills in 古安克维亚, but should they ever lead an attack on 恶魔十字, the casualties would be severe.{^n}{^n}This threat must be dealt with directly.
