赏金
Legends say that ghouls were once humans. Humans twisted by madness and obsessed with devouring dead flesh.{^n}{^n}Now they are little more than mindless fiends, too far gone to be reasoned with. 古代墓地 is teeming with these Corpse-eaters. There is little choice in the matter. They must be exterminated.{^n}{^n}Any such effort shall be rewarded with iron bits.
