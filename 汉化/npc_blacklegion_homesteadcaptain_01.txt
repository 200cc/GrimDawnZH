索梅尔队长
不用担心霍姆斯特德的安危。一切都尽在掌控。{^n}{^n}专心前往古代墓地。

保重。
别傻站在这儿。我知道你一定可以干点什么。
再见。
那是什么？
我有一些问题。
好，问吧。
你为什么这么讨厌艾格瑞姆？
哈！你这话说得有点不客气了，不过很对。帝国第一刃，或者更准确的说，这个艾格瑞姆现在自封的名号，跟黑色军团是有些渊源的。{^n}{^n}我觉得，最有名的莫过于他擅自处决了一名黑色军团的队长，原因是在一次平民起义期间，这名队长没有抓捕起义军并将他们投进监牢里。因为我们并没有接到直接的命令要把反抗军都给抓起来，所以……我们的队长相信艾格瑞姆还拥有些恻隐之心。不过对于艾格瑞姆这号人来说，我觉得这种想法实在是一种讽刺。{^n}{^n}皇帝虽然对第一刃的行为感到有些不满，但是却没有人认为需要给他任何正式的处罚，这让我的长官们感到难以接受。
我还有一个问题。
帝国的第一刃是什么？
第一刃是皇帝最信任的间谍和刺客，是政治黑暗面领域内的大师。{^n}{^n}人人都知道他的存在，但是没有人胆敢认为皇帝会诉诸于这种手段。

再见。
再见。
你能告诉我更多关于黑色军团的事吗？
你想知道些什么？
请给我讲一讲军团的历史。
黑色军团本身，如同它的历史一样，黑暗又纷繁复杂。During the Time of Troubles, when the empire was pressed by war on three fronts, refugees overwhelmed the capital and political dissent among the noble houses threatened to tear the government apart, thousands were imprisoned for political reasons, petty crime or just vagrancy. The prisons were overflowing and the military was crumbling for lack of recruits. I'm not sure anyone can remember who but someone, probably some bureaucrat, came up with the novel solution of sending the prisoners to fight on the front lines and supposedly win absolution.{^n}{^n}Most were unfit for battle and simply served as cannon fodder, shielding the regular units' advance, but some survived and did, indeed, win their freedom. Many more deserted though and eventually wound up back in prison. The empire corrected these imperfections though with the aid of the Luminari, who devised a process to essentially imprison the human will itself; mentally binding people into the service of the empire. They created a name, insignia and ritual to reinforce this desire to serve and thus was born the Black Legion.{^n}{^n}The detachment from personal life, unwavering sense of duty and unparalleled experience in the front lines of the harshest battles killed off the unfit and forged whoever remained into one of the most elite fighting regiments in the known world. The title "Death's Bannermen" was not handed out lightly. In time, because of our guaranteed loyalty and proven effectiveness in combat, we became the favored legion of the emperor himself; often at odds with the Erulan military high command and feared by the noble houses.{^n}{^n}You may be wondering now whether I've gone through the mental conditioning I spoke of and the answer is yes. I'm conscious of it all, I know I've been conditioned to be a loyal soldier but that knowledge doesn't change the feeling and I'm not sure it even matters. We are now what we are and, in all honesty, I can't say it is for the worse. {^n}{^n}I was a spoiled and deluded girl once. Heiress to one of the great houses of Erulan. I ended up in the legion due to my own and my family's betrayal of the empire and since then, my eyes have been opened to the larger world and I have found a true purpose. At one point, many years ago, my uncle abducted me from the legion, attempting to liberate me. In the end, I escaped and returned to duty. Despite the horrors I've seen, the spartan life and endless toil; the legion is like a drug that, once tasted, can't be quit.

我想问一些其他的事情。
这些和我平常听到的关于军团的故事差别很大。
嗯，大多数人都无法接受事情背后的真相。{^n}{^n}这是一个残酷的世界，帝国面对着众多的敌人，既有人类也有超自然力量。皇帝和他的继任者们只是为了生存做了应该做的事，所以在恐怖黎明到来之前伊露兰帝国才能保持繁荣昌盛。现在我们在一个更糟糕的世界挣扎度日，只能期望将来有一天能恢复帝国昔日的荣光。

我想问一些其他的事情。
我会保守秘密的。
That's quite a history.
告诉我首都当时发生了什么。
我印象最深的就是那些人的惨叫。数以千计的无辜的人被杀死了。遍布四处的裂隙中涌出人类从未见过的恶魔。{^n}{^n}那根本不是一场战斗，而是一场单方面的屠杀。帝国绝大多数的武装力量都驻扎在首都，因此都没能在最初的攻势中幸存下来。更多的人在试图逃离那个末日般的城市的过程中死掉了。{^n}{^n}黑色军团的指挥官塔基斯组织起了抵抗力量为我们殿后，我们才得以成功撤退。那是一次伟大的牺牲，我永远都不会忘了他。

我想问一些其他的事情。
听起来很不妙啊。
我想问一些其他的事情。
没事了。
关于克里德，你能告诉我些什么？
Inquisitor Creed worked for the Luminari, investigating and dealing with supernatural threats to the empire. It was he who first discovered the Aetherial conspiracy but, alas, not in time to stop it.{^n}{^n}Creed gathered trusted allies instead and laid the foundations for whatever human resistance exists today. The Black Legion survived the Grim Dawn largely thanks to his intervention. Since then he's been helping to coordinate our resistance and providing valuable insights into the nature of our supernatural foes.
他怎么知道那么多关于虚灵的事？
没人是虚灵专家，他也不例外。在恐怖黎明发生之前，我们对它们一无所知。这也是它们如此成功地侵入并击败帝国的原因之一。{^n}{^n}不过在幸存下来的人里面，克里德是恐怖黎明之前就跟虚灵打过交道的人员之一。显然，他是在光明会的宝库之中找到了关于虚灵的古籍。我们每天都会学到关于它们的新东西，可是它们还是能不断刷新我们的认知。我们仍然不知道它们到底来自何方……
我还有一个问题。
再见。
我还有一个问题。
再见。
What can you tell me about Fort Ikon?
Fort Ikon has withstood generations of warfare. It was originally constructed over 300 years ago during a drawn-out conflict with another human nation, long since conquered by Erulan.{^n}{^n}The Fort is our northern bastion, a beacon of the empire's strength.
Tell me about that war.
I'm not exactly a historian, but I'll give it my best shot.{^n}{^n}The North Wars as they came to be called were waged over the disputed lands beyond the Asterkarn Mountains. The area was rich in resources and provided ample farmland, so it proved to be a point of contention between the two great nations. Neither side would relent ownership of the territory, and so it came to war.{^n}{^n}The conflict dragged on over twenty six years before we finally pushed them back. That was not the end of the bloodshed though. Years later, the northerners returned with another army, intent on retaking the region. The final exchange marked one of the bloodiest days in the Empire's history. It was also one of the first campaigns undertaken by the Black Legion. Back then, we were still unproven, only a few battles under our banner; but the Legion proved to be a force to be reckoned with. That same year we marched all the way to their capital, and crushed them. That was the end of the North Wars.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
Forget it.
没事了，再见。
I've already informed Creed of your recent actions. He is most eager to speak with you.{^n}{^n}Show him what you've shown me. He needs to see this.
我这就去和克里德谈谈。
我一会儿再处理这件事。
审判官是谁？
Inquisitor Creed is one of Erulan's chief exterminators of the occult and the strange. Incidentally, he was outside the capital during the fall as he was tracking down just how deep the Aetherial corruption ran.{^n}{^n}Creed has played a critical role in the Legion's activities after the Grim Dawn, coordinating assaults and providing insight on the enemy.
我这就去和克里德谈谈。
I will speak to Creed another time.
他怎么知道那么多关于虚灵的事？
He has it on good authority. Now stop it with the questions and go speak to him immediately!
I will speak to Creed.
I can't right now.
Why do you have such a grim look on your face?{^n}{^n}What happened out there?
Karroz lies dead, but I found some disturbing information on him.
Let's see it.{^n}{^n}*Captain Somer is silent as she reads through the cultist's notes*{^n}{^n}I'll be damned. If the bastards pull this off, we may as well slit our own throats. This scenario is well beyond my pay-grade, or would be if I were getting paid. You will need to bring this to Creed's attention immediately.
审判官？

你追踪到目标了吗？
我该去哪找卡若兹？
We suspect that Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon, is at the Darkvale Gates, to the north of Sorrow's Bastion.{^n}{^n}Do not underestimate him. You do not get that high in the ranks of the Cult of Ch'thon without making some disturbing deals with the devil.
我会小心的。
还没有。
When the Legion was forced to abandon the Capital, we made Fort Ikon our new base of operations. It's an old fortress once used to protect the trade routes leading through the Alpine Valley.{^n}{^n}However, when we began marching south, we encountered immediate opposition from both the Cult and the Aetherials. Many of our men were killed, pincered between two opposing armies, and we were forced to retreat towards Homestead. The Aetherials now control the area known as the Conflagration, but the Cult of Ch'thon has taken residence within the Darkvale Gate, effectively cutting us off from our forces to the north. With the Cult's frontlines battered and their sacrifices freed, I believe it is now time to advance on their main position. {^n}{^n}Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon, the name has come up several times, including a recent bloody interrogation. We have no idea if he is the head of the entire Cult or if he is merely a pawn in someone else's game, but one thing is for certain: he is at the Darkvale Gate. I need you to infiltrate the fortress and take out their leader. Lay waste to the Cult's followers, let nothing stop you in reclaiming our bastion!
It will be done.
I won't do this.
I have already killed Karroz. I found some disturbing information on him.

I am told that Lisandra and a couple others have returned safely from captivity, all thanks to you. We thought they were as good as dead after they disappeared in the Blood Grove.
The cult must be stopped.
I could not agree more. We've been cut off from Fort Ikon long enough.
What's our next step?

别再浪费时间了，我们等得越久，邪教徒就会召唤越多的冥灵。
Where is the Cult of Ch'thon entrenched?
You will have to venture out beyond Sorrow's Bastion, to the north of Homestead, and search the cultist camps. Rescue any survivors before the Cult of Ch'thon can use them as sacrifices.
我这就出发。
我这就出发。
I was going to have you interrupt the cult's supply of sacrifices, but with Lisandra's recent return, I'm beginning to think that you can be in several places at once.{^n}{^n}Good work there. We cannot afford to have the cult summon additional reinforcements from the void. The next priority though, that's a bit tougher.
What is it?

My scouts have reported back from the lands to the north. The situation is far worse than I ever imagined. The Cult of Ch'thon is on our doorstep, and in great numbers. Worse still, they've been capturing farmers, travelers, even my own soldiers and using them for their blood rituals.{^n}{^n}We cannot risk the cult bolstering their forces with Chthonic beings. I need you to venture out beyond Sorrow's Bastion to the north and search their camps. Rescue any survivors before the cultists can use them as sacrifices.
I will rescue the prisoners.
Sorry, I cannot right now.
What can I expect out there?
Terrors from the void, crazed humans hell-bent on harvesting your blood for their heathen god, unspeakable dark rituals. The Cult of Ch'thon is a despicable group of degenerates that needs to be wiped out.{^n}{^n}I would not ask this of you if I did not think you capable. Will you stop the sacrifices?
I will rescue the prisoners.
Sorry, I cannot right now.
There was much commotion reported in the area around the Gruesome Harvest, I trust you have good news?
The abomination has been destroyed.
I see your reputation is well earned. The Legion thanks you for your service to the emperor.{^n}{^n}With the Aetherial threat crippled, we can now turn our attention to the Cult of Ch'thon.
I'm eager to get started.


We will speak of this another time.
I hope I didn't make a mistake by sending you.
Where are the Aetherials?
They are in an area we are calling the Gruesome Harvest. You'll know why when you see it.{^n}{^n}You will have to go through the Infested Farms and the Rotting Croplands to the west of Homestead.
我这就出发。
No, you have not.
I see you've returned. Changed your mind about serving the Legion?{^n}{^n}Or would you rather sit back and enjoy some of Ulgrim's 'fine' soup?
Where do you need me?
The Legion is split on two fronts. To the north, we have the Cult of Ch'thon. Nasty bastards keen on turning all of us into a puddle of blood for their rituals. I have my best men out there right now, scouting ahead. The cultists are amassing in great numbers, and I'd like to know why.{^n}{^n}There is a more pressing issue, however, and this is where you come in. Ulgrim says that you are experienced with fighting the Aetherials. That's good. You'll need all your skills for this one. Far to the west, beyond the Infested Farms and the Rotting Croplands, there is an area teeming with Aetherials that we have started calling the Gruesome Harvest. It is a fitting title as the Aetherials have been gathering corpses, animal and human alike, in order to conduct their sick resurrection techniques upon them.{^n}{^n}The barn there has been giving off a blinding aether light nonstop for the last few days and nights. That is, until today. Whatever they are working on, it must be nearly finished. And knowing the Aetherials, it's something monstrous.{^n}{^n}We can't risk the Aetherials discovering that we know about their creation. I need someone to sneak in there and destroy this abomination before it even has a chance to wreck havoc upon my people. We'll only get one shot at this, so I want someone who has experience dealing with Aetherial horrors to handle this mission.{^n}{^n}Will you be my champion?
I will track down this abomination.
I am not risking my life for this.
I've already slain the abomination.
I see your reputation is well-earned. The Legion thanks you for your service to the emperor.{^n}{^n}With the Aetherial threat crippled, we can now turn our attention to the Cult of Ch'thon.



Hope the campaign goes well.
What about the Dermapterans?
Been talking to Douglass? Look, I'd love to solve all the world's problems, but unfortunately I do not have the troops to send them out on a bug hunt.{^n}{^n}Douglass and the other farmers will just have to accept it for now. Perhaps later, once the Aetherials and Chthonians have been dealt with, then I can think about sending some men out to the fields to clear out this infestation.
你还需要我做什么？
很好。
黑色军团是个什么组织？
你在开玩笑，是么？{^n}{^n}We are the imperium's most infamous if not elite legion; conscripted from criminals and political outcasts and tempered in the front lines of the empire's most brutal wars. The only regiment of the emperor's legions that has survived the massacre in the capital, if you could consider the losses we suffered surviving.{^n}{^n}I'd love to tell you our history, but I really have more important matters to attend to. Such as the mission I need you for. The question really is, are you up to it?

Not interested in heroics.
Not interested in heroics.
I'll skip the pleasantries. Ulgrim tells me you're one tough slith and right now that's what I need most.{^n}{^n}Will you fight for the Black Legion?
Where do you need me?

黑色军团是个什么组织？
You are joking, right?{^n}{^n}We are the imperium's elite. The only regiment of the emperor's legions that has survived the massacre in the capital, if you could consider the losses we suffered surviving.{^n}{^n}I'd love to tell you our history, but I really have more important matters to attend to. Such as the mission I need you for. The question really is, are you up to it?

我对英雄主义不感兴趣。
我对英雄主义不感兴趣。
I hear you've dragged Ulgrim's sorry ass out of Deadman's Gulch. Good work.{^n}{^n}Come see me later. Perhaps we can put your skills to some use.
I take it you don't like Ulgrim?
Let's just say Ulgrim and the Black Legion have a history.
我……懂了。
I'll think about it.
Welcome to Homestead. We could definitely use more capable hands around here.{^n}{^n}If you find yourself back out there and run into a smug smartass by the name Ulgrim, tell him he's late, as usual...
我有一些问题。
What is it?
你能把打开大门么？
在我接到艾格瑞姆的报告之前，任何人都不准从大门出去。
我还有一个问题。
Very well.
这里情况如何？
I'd tell you that I've dealt with worse, but I'm not sure that's true. The situation here is about as bad as it gets.{^n}{^n}We have Aetherials and the Cult of Ch'thon on our doorstep, few supplies, no heavy weapons and barely enough men to keep it all together.
我还有一个问题。
听起来很不妙啊。
What can you tell me about the Black Legion?
What's there to say that isn't widespread public knowledge. We are a band of criminals, misfits and political outcasts conscripted into the service of the empire. Yet, as an army of expendables forever in the front lines of the empire's harshest wars, we've been forged by iron and blood into one of the most elite fighting groups in the known world.{^n}{^n}We suffered significant losses in the Grim Dawn but thanks to Creed's warning, we fared better than others and we're not done fighting yet.
我还有一个问题。
谢谢。
那是审判官克里德吗？
你怎么知道的？{^n}{^n}他就是克里德。在恐怖黎明之后，审判官克里德和黑色军团一起紧密地合作。他对于虚灵的了解让我们得以活到现在。
我在伯尔维治找到了他曾经到访那里的证据。
是的，他曾去那里处理典狱长克里格在进行的一些邪恶的勾当。但是克里德差点死在他手里。
我已经杀掉了典狱长。
如果你说的是真的，那么你将得到我的敬意。
我还有一个问题。
再见。

没事了。
