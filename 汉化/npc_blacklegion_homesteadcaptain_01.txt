索梅尔队长
不用担心霍姆斯特德的安危。一切都尽在掌控。{^n}{^n}专心前往大墓地。

保重。
别傻站在这儿。我知道你一定可以干点什么。
再见。
那是什么？
我有一些问题。
好，问吧。
你为什么这么讨厌艾格瑞姆？
哈！你这话说得有点不客气了，不过很对。帝国第一刃，或者更准确的说，艾格瑞姆现在自封的名号，跟黑色军团是有些渊源的。{^n}{^n}我觉得，最著名的莫过于他处决了一名黑色军团的队长，原因是在一次平民起义期间，他没有抓捕起义军将他们投进监牢里。我们并没有接到直接的命运要抓捕反抗军，所以……我们的队长想激发艾格瑞姆的怜悯之心。不过对于艾格瑞姆这号人来说，我觉得实在是一种讽刺。{^n}{^n}皇帝对第一刃的行为感到不满，但是却没有人认为需要给他任何正式的处罚，这让我的长官们感到难以接受。
我还有一个问题。
帝国的第一刃是什么？
第一刃是皇帝最信任的间谍和刺客，是政治黑暗面领域中的大师。{^n}{^n}人人都知道他的存在，但是没有人胆敢认为皇帝会诉诸于这种手段。

再见。
再见。
你能告诉我更多关于黑色军团的事吗？
你想知道些什么？
请给我讲一讲军团的历史。
黑色军团本身，如同它的历史一样，黑暗又纷繁复杂。During the Time of Troubles, when the empire was pressed by war on three fronts, refugees overwhelmed the capital and political dissent among the noble houses threatened to tear the government apart, thousands were imprisoned for political reasons, petty crime or just vagrancy. The prisons were overflowing and the military was crumbling for lack of recruits. I'm not sure anyone can remember who but someone, probably some bureaucrat, came up with the novel solution of sending the prisoners to fight on the front lines and supposedly win absolution.{^n}{^n}Most were unfit for battle and simply served as cannon fodder, shielding the regular units' advance, but some survived and did, indeed, win their freedom. Many more deserted though and eventually wound up back in prison. The empire corrected these imperfections though with the aid of the Luminari, who devised a process to essentially imprison the human will itself; mentally binding people into the service of the empire. They created a name, insignia and ritual to reinforce this desire to serve and thus was born the Black Legion.{^n}{^n}The detachment from personal life, unwavering sense of duty and unparalleled experience in the front lines of the harshest battles killed off the unfit and forged whoever remained into one of the most elite fighting regiments in the known world. The title "Death's Bannermen" was not handed out lightly. In time, because of our guaranteed loyalty and proven effectiveness in combat, we became the favored legion of the emperor himself; often at odds with the Erulan military high command and feared by the noble houses.{^n}{^n}You may be wondering now whether I've gone through the mental conditioning I spoke of and the answer is yes. I'm conscious of it all, I know I've been conditioned to be a loyal soldier but that knowledge doesn't change the feeling and I'm not sure it even matters. We are now what we are and, in all honesty, I can't say it is for the worse. {^n}{^n}I was a spoiled and deluded girl once. Heiress to one of the great houses of Erulan. I ended up in the legion due to my own and my family's betrayal of the empire and since then, my eyes have been opened to the larger world and I have found a true purpose. At one point, many years ago, my uncle abducted me from the legion, attempting to liberate me. In the end, I escaped and returned to duty. Despite the horrors I've seen, the spartan life and endless toil; the legion is like a drug that, once tasted, can't be quit.

我想问一些其他的事情。
That isn't something you usually hear about the Legion.
Well, most people can't stomach the truth.{^n}{^n}It's a harsh world and the empire had many enemies, both mortal and supernatural. The emperor and his predecessors did what needed to be done to survive and Erulan flourished until the Grim Dawn. Now we struggle on in a world worse for its passing and can only hope to some day recapture that glory.

我想问一些其他的事情。
我会保守秘密的。
That's quite a history.
Tell me about what happened in the capital.
What I remember most is the screams. Innocents being slaughtered by the thousands. Rifts opening up all over the place and spilling out fiends unlike any mankind had ever seen.{^n}{^n}It wasn't a battle. It was a massacre. Most of the imperial forces still stationed within the capital did not survive the initial attack. Many more fell while trying to flee from the doomed city.{^n}{^n}The Black Legion's Commander Tarkis stayed behind to rally a defense while we made our retreat. It was a noble sacrifice and one I will never forget.

我想问一些其他的事情。
听起来很不妙啊。
我想问一些其他的事情。
Actually, nevermind.
关于克里德，你能告诉我些什么？
Inquisitor Creed worked for the Luminari, investigating and dealing with supernatural threats to the empire. It was he who first discovered the Aetherial conspiracy but, alas, not in time to stop it.{^n}{^n}Creed gathered trusted allies instead and laid the foundations for whatever human resistance exists today. The Black Legion survived the Grim Dawn largely thanks to his intervention. Since then he's been helping to coordinate our resistance and providing valuable insights into the nature of our supernatural foes.
他怎么知道那么多关于虚灵的事？
没人是虚灵专家，他也不例外。在恐怖黎明发生之前，我们对它们一无所知。这也是它们如此成功地侵入并击败帝国的原因之一。{^n}{^n}不过在幸存下来的人里面，克里德是恐怖黎明之前就跟虚灵打过交道的人员之一。显然，他是在光明会的宝库之中找到了关于虚灵的古籍。我们每天都会学到关于它们的新东西，可是它们还是能不断刷新我们的认知。我们仍然不知道它们到底来自何方……
我还有一个问题。
再见。
我还有一个问题。
再见。
Forget it.
Nothing. Goodbye.
I've already informed Creed of your recent actions. He is most eager to speak with you.{^n}{^n}Show him what you've shown me. He needs to see this.
我这就去和克里德谈谈。
我一会儿再处理这件事。
审判官是谁？
Inquisitor Creed is one of Erulan's chief exterminators of the occult and the strange. Incidentally, he was outside the capital during the fall as he was tracking down just how deep the Aetherial corruption ran.{^n}{^n}Creed has played a critical role in the Legion's activities after the Grim Dawn, coordinating assaults and providing insight on the enemy.
我这就去和克里德谈谈。
I will speak to Creed another time.
他怎么知道那么多关于虚灵的事？
He has it on good authority. Now stop it with the questions and go speak to him immediately!
I will speak to Creed.
I can't right now.
Why do you have such a grim look on your face?{^n}{^n}What happened out there?
Karroz lies dead, but I found some disturbing information on him.
Let's see it.{^n}{^n}*Captain Somer is silent as she reads through the cultist's notes*{^n}{^n}I'll be damned. If the bastards pull this off, we may as well slit our own throats. This scenario is well beyond my pay-grade or would be if I were ever paid. You will need to bring this to Creed's attention immediately.
The inquisitor?

Have you tracked down the target?
Where should I be looking for Karroz?
We suspect that Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon, is hiding out somewhere in one of the larger cultist camps to the north of Sorrow's Bastion.{^n}{^n}Do not underestimate him. You do not get that high in the ranks of the Cult of Ch'thon without making some disturbing deals with the devil.
I'll be careful.
Not yet.
Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon. That is the name of the cult's leader in the area. We have no idea if he is the head of the entire organization or if he is merely a pawn in someone else's game, but his name has come up several times, including a recent bloody interrogation.{^n}{^n}Karroz is hiding out somewhere north of Sorrow's Bastion, likely in one of the bigger camps. His death would surely cripple the cult's chain of command. Anything I need done is clearly beneath Ulgrim's dainty nose, so it falls to you. Will you be my assassin?
It will be done.
I won't do this.
I have already killed Karroz. I found some disturbing information on him.

I am told that Lisandra and a couple others have returned safely from captivity, all thanks to you. We thought they were as good as dead after they disappeared in Old Grove.
The cult must be stopped.
I could not agree more, and now we have a key bit of information that could help drive this conflict to a swift conclusion.
What did you learn?

Stop wasting time. The longer we wait, the more Chthonians will be at the cult's command.
Where is the Cult of Ch'thon entrenched?
You will have to venture out beyond Sorrow's Bastion, to the north of Homestead, and search the cultist camps. Rescue any survivors before the Cult of Ch'thon can use them as sacrifices.
I'm on it.
I'm on it.
I was going to have you interrupt the cult's supply of sacrifices, but with Lisandra's recent return, I'm beginning to think that you can be in several places at once.{^n}{^n}Good work there. We cannot afford to have the cult summon additional reinforcements from the void. The next priority though, that's a bit tougher.
What is it?

My scouts have reported back from the lands to the north. The situation is far worse than I ever imagined. The Cult of Ch'thon is on our doorstep, and in great numbers. Worse still, they've been capturing farmers, travelers, even my own soldiers and using them for their blood rituals.{^n}{^n}We cannot risk the cult bolstering their forces with Chthonic beings. I need you to venture out beyond Sorrow's Bastion to the north and search their camps. Rescue any survivors before the cultists can use them as sacrifices.
I will rescue the prisoners.
Sorry, I cannot right now.
What can I expect out there?
Terrors from the void, crazed humans hell-bent on harvesting your blood for their heathen god, unspeakable dark rituals. The Cult of Ch'thon is a despicable group of degenerates that needs to be wiped out.{^n}{^n}I would not ask this of you if I did not think you capable. Will you stop the sacrifices?
I will rescue the prisoners.
Sorry, I cannot right now.
There was much commotion reported in the area around the Gruesome Harvest, I trust you have good news?
The abomination has been destroyed.
I see your reputation is well earned. The Legion thanks you for your service to the emperor.{^n}{^n}With the Aetherial threat crippled, we can now turn our attention to the Cult of Ch'thon.
I'm eager to get started.


We will speak of this another time.
I hope I didn't make a mistake by sending you.
Where are the Aetherials?
They are in an area we are calling the Gruesome Harvest. You'll know why when you see it.{^n}{^n}You will have to go through the Infested Farms and the Rotting Croplands to the west of Homestead.
I'm on it.
No, you have not.
I see you've returned. Changed your mind about serving the Legion?{^n}{^n}Or would you rather sit back and enjoy some of Ulgrim's 'fine' soup?
Where do you need me?
The Legion is split on two fronts. To the north, we have the Cult of Ch'thon. Nasty bastards keen on turning all of us into a puddle of blood for their rituals. I have my best men out there right now, scouting ahead. The cultists are amassing in great numbers, and I'd like to know why.{^n}{^n}There is a more pressing issue, however, and this is where you come in. Ulgrim says that you are experienced with fighting the Aetherials. That's good. You'll need all your skills for this one. Far to the west, beyond the Infested Farms and the Rotting Croplands, there is an area teeming with Aetherials that we have started calling the Gruesome Harvest. It is a fitting title as the Aetherials have been gathering corpses, animal and human alike, in order to conduct their sick resurrection techniques upon them.{^n}{^n}The barn there has been giving off a blinding aether light nonstop for the last few days and nights. That is, until today. Whatever they are working on, it must be nearly finished. And knowing the Aetherials, it's something monstrous.{^n}{^n}We can't risk the Aetherials discovering that we know about their creation. I need someone to sneak in there and destroy this abomination before it even has a chance to wreck havoc upon my people. We'll only get one shot at this, so I want someone who has experience dealing with Aetherial horrors to handle this mission.{^n}{^n}Will you be my champion?
I will track down this abomination.
I am not risking my life for this.
I've already slain the abomination.
I see your reputation is well-earned. The Legion thanks you for your service to the emperor.{^n}{^n}With the Aetherial threat crippled, we can now turn our attention to the Cult of Ch'thon.



Hope the campaign goes well.
What about the Dermapterans?
Been talking to Douglass? Look, I'd love to solve all the world's problems, but unfortunately I do not have the troops to send them out on a bug hunt.{^n}{^n}Douglass and the other farmers will just have to accept it for now. Perhaps later, once the Aetherials and Chthonians have been dealt with, then I can think about sending some men out to the fields to clear out this infestation.
What did you need from me again?
Very well.
What's the Black Legion?
You are joking, right?{^n}{^n}We are the imperium's most infamous if not elite legion; conscripted from criminals and political outcasts and tempered in the front lines of the empire's most brutal wars. The only regiment of the emperor's legions that has survived the massacre in the capital, if you could consider the losses we suffered surviving.{^n}{^n}I'd love to tell you our history, but I really have more important matters to attend to. Such as the mission I need you for. The question really is, are you up to it?

Not interested in heroics.
Not interested in heroics.
I'll skip the pleasantries. Ulgrim tells me you're one tough slith and right now that's what I need most.{^n}{^n}Will you fight for the Black Legion?
Where do you need me?

What's the Black Legion?
You are joking, right?{^n}{^n}We are the imperium's elite. The only regiment of the emperor's legions that has survived the massacre in the capital, if you could consider the losses we suffered surviving.{^n}{^n}I'd love to tell you our history, but I really have more important matters to attend to. Such as the mission I need you for. The question really is, are you up to it?

Not interested in heroics.
Not interested in heroics.
I hear you've dragged Ulgrim's sorry ass out of Deadman's Gulch. Good work.{^n}{^n}Come see me later. Perhaps we can put your skills to some use.
I take it you don't like Ulgrim?
Let's just say Ulgrim and the Black Legion have a history.
我……懂了。
I'll think about it.
Welcome to Homestead. We could definitely use more capable hands around here.{^n}{^n}If you find yourself back out there and run into a smug smartass by the name Ulgrim, tell him he's late, as usual...
我有一些问题。
What is it?
Can you open the gates?
Nobody's going through those gates until I've received Ulgrim's report.
I have another question.
Very well.
What is the situation here?
I'd tell you that I've dealt with worse, but I'm not sure that's true. The situation here is about as bad as it gets.{^n}{^n}We have Aetherials and the Cult of Ch'thon on our doorstep, few supplies, no heavy weapons and barely enough men to keep it all together.
我还有一个问题。
Sounds rough.
What can you tell me about the Black Legion?
What's there to say that isn't widespread public knowledge. We are a band of criminals, misfits and political outcasts conscripted into the service of the empire. Yet, as an army of expendables forever in the front lines of the empire's harshest wars, we've been forged by iron and blood into one of the most elite fighting groups in the known world.{^n}{^n}We suffered significant losses in the Grim Dawn but thanks to Creed's warning, we fared better than others and we're not done fighting yet.
我还有一个问题。
谢谢。
那是审判官克里德吗？
你怎么知道的？{^n}{^n}他就是克里德。在恐怖黎明之后，审判官克里德和黑色军团一起紧密地合作。他对于虚灵的了解让我们得以活到现在。
我在伯尔维治找到了他曾经到访那里的证据。
是的，他曾去那里处理典狱长克里格在进行的一些邪恶的勾当。但是克里德差点死在他手里。
我已经杀掉了典狱长。
如果你说的是真的，那么你将得到我的敬意。
我还有一个问题。
再见。
