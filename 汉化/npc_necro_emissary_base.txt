哈鲁夫
Greetings. I trust all goes well in our war against the invaders?
Where is the Order of Death's Vigil sanctum?
We have taken over a small crypt to the north, beyond the Blood Grove. Sadly, it is near Sorrow's Bastion, the reviled sanctuary of Kymon's Chosen.
谢谢。
再见。
你玷污了这个地方，狂徒。
我这就走。
你好。
再见。
You have entered the presence of the Order of Death's Vigil. Tread carefully, stranger.
再见。
Please, visit out sanctum. Master Varuuk will wish to speak with you.
Where is your sanctum?
Our sanctum is located west of the old fort ruins in the north, known as Sorrow's Bastion.{^n}{^n}To get there, you must take the road north out of Homestead, through the Blood Grove.
Thank you.
I'm on my way.
I would ask that you seek out our sanctum to the north. We have claimed a small crypt hidden in the mountains, just west of Sorrow's Bastion.{^n}{^n}To get there, you must take the road north through the Blood Grove. When you've reached the old fort ruins, then you are close to our home.{^n}{^n}Once inside, see Master Varuuk. He will wish to speak with our new ally.
I will seek out your sanctum.
Perhaps another time.
You have entered the presence of the Order of Death's Vigil. Tread carefully, stranger.
Farewell.
