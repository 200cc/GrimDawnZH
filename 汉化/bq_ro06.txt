赏金：The Oligarchs
Bounty
The Oligarchs were once leaders of Arkovian society, following the abdication of the throne by King Rhowan. Even in death, they command loyalty from their undying subjects.{^n}{^n}Three such spirits still roam 古安克维亚地下城, their hatred for the living spurring the undead into a frenzy. For the sake of all travelers, the Oligarchs must be destroyed.{^n}{^n}To see this through, we have set aside a substantial stash of iron bits.
